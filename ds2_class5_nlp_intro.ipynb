       "[(\"wow ! what a movie . it ' s everything a movie can be : funny , dramatic , interesting , weird , funny , weird and strikingly original . yep that pretty much describes this movie . it starts out like a regular movie and ends up being one of the weirdest , funniest most original movies i have ever seen . it boggles the mind and some have to wonder why we cannot get movies like this more often . besides being one of the best films of the year , being john malkovich may as well be one of the best movies ever . period . then again there are so many good movies , that one cannot pick an all time favorite . john cusack plays a puppeteer craig schwartz a man out of a job , in search of a job . his wife lotte schwartz who is played by a completely un - noticeable cameron diaz who looks like something off the streets is an animal lover and has about every kind of animal you could think of . craig finds a job as a file at the 7 ? floor of a business building . . . you have to pry open the elevator doors open before it reaches floor eight , the 7 ? floor is just a floor between 7 and 8 . he is hired by his 105 year old boss ( orsen bean ) to be a filer . in his office , he discovers a little door , to which was boarded up and hidden . to his curiosity he opens it and starts to crawl toward it , he then gets sucked to the end and ends up in john malkovich ' s mind . fifteen minutes later he is shot out onto the side of the new jersey turnpike . he returns to tell his co - worker maxine ( catherine keener ) that he has found a portal that will lead him into john malkovich ' s mind , she doesn ' t believe him but after she sees it it changes her mind . lotte also finds out about the portal and discovers that being someone else is good after all . john malkovich of course has no idea what is going on , and by the end of this bizarre film there are so many twists and turns , that we don ' t know what really happened . john cusack is outstanding and utterly believeable in a role only he himself could play . he fits the role perfectly and to me was brilliantly cast . cameron diaz is outstanding and utterly one of the world ' s most prettiest women , is made up here unnoticeable and very unattractive . she however gives a very comic performance and this could easily be her best role to date . catherine keener is very funny and sexy as maxine and of course the best thing of the movie is the magic himself john malkovich who is very brilliant and this movie plays big time homage ? to the master himself . the whole group combined gives us a wonderfully funny movie that is also smart and clever . spike jonze ( three kings ) makes his fabulous directing debut , and did a fantastic job of directing this new classic film . he lets the viewer go on the trip as well as let the viewer know they are watching a movie . by the time the ending rolled around my head was spinning from disbelief of how good this film was . the screenplay written by charlie kaufman was hilarious and often thought - provoking . the film also had a soft side to it and even though the ending is very surprising it is also a little sad and heart - warming . the whole movie was fantastic and had me rolling in the isles . from cameron diaz ' s appearence to john malkovich ' s explorations i laughed very hard , and it may as well be as funny as as good as it gets ( the funniest ! ) . there isn ' t a slow point in the movie , or an overused idea . there are no cliches except for the fact that this is the most original , inventie , witty , and smart movie i ' ve seen in a long time . i found myself amazed by everything : the direction , acting , writing and the whole idea of the movie . by the end i had to wonder why hollywood doesn ' t want to make movies like this anymore . or why they don ' t . all filmmakers watch this movie and get some ideas of movies to come out . this was a surprise hit as was american beauty . ' being john malkovich ' is in the top 5 movies of the year , and in the top 10 best films ever made . it has something that no other movies playing now has . in fact it may as well be the best movie out right now . i highly recommend ' being john malkovich ' and have no doubts you will be disappointed .\",\n",

       " ('note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . be forewarned . among my fanatical ticker tape - worshipping friends , there \\' s one who happens to share the same philosophy espoused by the central character in darren aronofsky \\' s darkly original pi : the entire stock market can be reduced to nothing but a series of patterns which , through analysis , will produce information to accurately forecast future behaviour . ( an example of the mentality involved : if the stock price goes up like this , and then down like that , and then sharply up this way , it then will go * this * way . ) while i freely admit that i know less than nothing about the market ( knowledge check : prices up -- good ; prices down -- bad ; most of the time , at least ) and hence really couldn \\' t comment with any authority , it \\' s always nonetheless struck me as an incredibly naive oversimplification of an astonishingly complex system ( and besides , if it were that simple , no doubt somebody would \\' ve already figured it all out ) . the difference in this case is that while my colleague ( an otherwise assuredly realistic individual ) truly believes in this in and of itself as a valid forecaster , pi uses this ideology as a device with which to investigate its character \\' s psychosis . it \\' s also vastly more convincing with its argument . \" mathematics is the language of the universe , \" insists genius protagonist maximillian cohen ( sean gullette ) in a cool , mantra - like voice - over which repeats throughout the picture . since nature can be expressed in numbers , and there are patterns everywhere in nature , he reasons with eminent logic that finding the patterns will allow him to predict anything -- the ups and downs of the stock market , how many games the yankees will win this year , the flavour of jam i \\' m going to put on my toast tomorrow morning . obsessed with finding the proverbial key to the universe , max lives in paranoid , self - imposed solitude in a seedy nyc chinatown apartment , single - mindedly toiling away with his monstrous homemade computer system . sullenly withdrawn and plauged by debilitating migraines , the elusive pursuit of a mysterious 216 - digit number his machine spits out one day is driving him into madness . the story , then , is basically an eccentricity , but it \\' s a clever , astute eccentricity , perceptively zeroing in on the modern mistrust of mathematical reductionism ; in an age where a dominant societal phobia is one \\' s individualism being replaced by a series of numeric identifiers , max \\' s all - consuming penchent for numbers at once creates a lingering , unsettling mood . it helps matters that he \\' s not a particularly likable protagonist . all attempts of friendliness from neighbours are curtly rebuffed by max , a spindly , neurotic - looking individual who hasn \\' t the time to indulge in pleasantries . for a film which puts its lead character front and center ( mr . gullette appears in virtually every scene ) , pi takes a refreshing and effective approach in avoiding conventional aesthetics ; because of our ambivalence with max , we \\' re not so much avidly rooting for him to triumph with a moment of epiphany as we \\' re following him through this plot with a sense of mixed dread and morbid fascination -- it \\' s more disturbing journey than quest . still , we do care about max \\' s fate . teetering on the edge of dementia , he winds up being pursued by two different groups which want to pick his brain , both fronted by deliciously perky , resolutely cheerful representatives with inevitably duplictious intentions . as we know , in films where paranoia is a dominant element ( see the truman show \\' s laura linney character ) , or for that matter , in real life , it \\' s always the ones who never stop smiling at you and are overly friendly that are the ones of which to be wary . pi , a film that addresses patterns , itself intentionally adheres to an identifiable pattern cycle -- headache scene ; important revelation or bit of plot development ; pill - popping montage ; hallucinatory nightmare ( with decidedly cronenberg - esque undertones -- few other directors are as equally adept in bridging unsettling concepts and body - themed horror ) ; nosebleeding reality . the repetitiveness , far from being tedious , is effectively maddening ; more than anything , the picture aims to get under our skins and take in events from max \\' s claustrophobic perspective . in this regard , it wildly succeeds due to mr . aronofsky \\' s striking direction . it \\' s a rarity that a film so completely immerses itself into a protagonist \\' s warped perspective of his surrounding , and high contrast black - and - white cinematography combined with constant usage of extreme close - ups lend a heightened sense of paranoia to the proceedings . ( in some scenes , the stark composition in conjunction with the lumbering approach by mr . gullette make his character curiously resemble a latter - day max schreck , from nosferatu . ) using savage , jittery lensing and rapid cuts to create a sense of disorientation , the picture is often dizzying to behold , and max \\' s effective isolationism is emphasized by shots from the so - called snorri cam , which keep him in plain focus while the environment races by in blurred bursts . pi \\' s raw , aggressive visuals are reminiscent of david lynch \\' s early work ( in particular , eraserhead ) . the film \\' s sinister tone splashes onto the screen immediately with a dazzling opening credit sequence ably backed by a sly electronic score by clint mansell , and gradually increases in intensity . still , amidst all its kafkaesque qualities and overall dispassionate mood , pi does occasionally display a sense of humour . at one point , marcy dawson ( pamela hart , great fun ) entices max with the offer of an invaluable treasure : a one - of - a - kind . . . computer chip . \" isn \\' t it beautiful , \" she coos . a showcase for mr . aronofsky \\' s technical virtuosity ( made for $ 60 000 , it \\' s since gone on to capture acclaim at the 1998 sundance film festival ) , pi is an intriguingly cerebral story which , ironically , is perhaps the most purely visceral film of the year .',\n",

       " (\"the premise is simple , if not bizarre . a mad scientist ( trace beaulieu as dr . clayton forrester ) launches an average - joe ( michael j . nelson as mike nelson ) into space where he forces his subject to watch the most horrendous movies ever made . why ? it ' s torturous , it ' s maniacal , and it ' s just plain fun . based on the cult - favorite cable television series , mystery science theater 3000 : the movie isn ' t torturous , but as for being maniacal and just plain fun , it foots the bill quite nicely . mike nelson , on a dog - bone shaped spacecraft , spends his days as any young man would dream - indulging in sarcasm and horseplay , and seeing quite a few movies . the catch is , these movies aren ' t the movies he chooses , but retched examples of film - making chosen specifically by dr . forrester in an attempt to break mike ' s will to live . dr . forrester is convinced that one too many b - movies is all it will take to ruin a man , but with a couple of wise - cracking puppet buddies ( tom servo , voiced by kevin murphy , and crow t . robot , voiced by beaulieu ) , the torture becomes somewhat of a honorary party for all that is wrong in the world of cheezy cinema . the purpose behind mst3k is to exploit some of the worst films known ( even if by very few of us ) to man . we watch as the silhouettes of mike , tom , and crow sit in a darkened theater poking fun at the movie going on before them . in this case , it ' s the 1954 sci - fi film this island earth . we basically watch as our three leads watch , only we get the pleasure of eavesdropping on their hilarious commentary . the plots behind the movies ripped apart are really quite irrelevant , but for the sake of those who might want to know , i ' ll explain this one . this island earth is the tale of two scientists , a man and a woman , who wind up aboard a spaceship whose crew intends to destroy the earth . together the two fight to survive as well as save their home planet . to make mst3k work , the film - within - the - film naturally has to be as horrible as possible , and although the tv - series introduced us to several worse films than this island earth , it ' s a bad enough flick to bring about some hysterical cruelty . mst3k , which doesn ' t actually contain the complete this island earth , is a short 73 minutes , but this is a step very wisely taken . as funny as some of their observations are , it can only go so long . occasional breaks from this island earth also help the film tremendously . although it takes a second to get back into the right mode after this premise has been left for a moment , it ' s better than overkilling the whole concept post haste . mst3k lovers will likely hail the film greatly , but if you don ' t know what you ' re in for , it could be a jarring disappointment . although i thought the sharp wit of this film was worth three stars , it is a movie to be seen on home video , late at night when your brain is not functioning to full capacity anyway , and with a large , saracastic crowd - new year ' s at midnight for example , which is when i saw it . warning : although mst3k has more to its end credits than most ( the three leads use the credits to poke some more fun ) , they are actually more annoying than most . the name slandering and asinine one - liners were extremely unfunny , and after laughing for about 70 minutes straight , it put a heavy damper on the overall experience . most people will likely stay to see what the smart - alec ' s have to say , but for me , it almost ruined an otherwise good film .\",\n",

       " ('as a revolutionary war hero in the patriot , mel gibson provides another macho man performance for hollywood audiences . you know the type : his shirt is always shredded , his face always scarred , he has a soft spot for his loved ones and a \" to kill \" list for his enemies . oscar - hungry director / executive producer roland emmerich did not intend to , but he made the stereotypical action hero for the 18th century . as gibson delivers lines like , \" before this war is over , i am going to kill you , \" schwarzenegger in commando or stallone in cobra immediately come to mind . oddly enough , the patriot is as much an epic three - hour - tear - fest like gladiator , as it is a ninety - minute guilty pleasure . at times absorbing , at others enjoyably insipid , this is good , bloody summer fun . i probably would have despised this film had it not been released over the july 4th weekend . some of the images are so zealously americanized ( the flag is used as a lifesaving weapon for example ) , that independence day seems the only appropriate time of year to wholeheartedly accept it . like emmerich \\' s id4 , this is obvious propaganda where the americans are the hapless underdogs motivated by freedom for all . sure it \\' s predictable and melodramatic , but for a moment after leaving the theater , i was dumbfounded with patriotism . and isn \\' t that the point of the patriot ? gibson plays benjamin martin , the lionized french and indian war veteran , who , at the beginning of the film , is emotionally suffering after his loving wife passed away . he is left to father seven children at his south carolina estate along with black servants ( not slaves ! ) . as the revolutionary war rumbles miles away , martin swears to keep his family close and away from the battlefields . but when the oldest son enlists anyway and another is murdered by a wicked redcoat colonel ( jason isaacs ) , martin quickly decides to save the day ( or save the fate of america as presented by emmerich ) . forming a band of aggressive farmers and using guerilla tactics considered unfair in the art of war , martin becomes the number one target of the british army . the best parts of the patriot are the scenes in which martin and his rugged militia men outsmart the british armies left and right . every time the farmers attacked the unsuspecting enemy , to see the disbelief on british general cornwallis \\' ( tom wilkinson ) face was priceless entertainment . and as the tension gradually formulates with the running time , a final battle is inevitable . as for the numerous battle scenes , they are expertly done . clearer and more realistic than those of gladiator , the gruesome images are what give this film an r rating . you really get a sense of how warfare was performed during that time period . everything is performed in an orderly ( but still quite gory ) fashion - one side shoots , then the other side , then the remaining soldiers charge . it \\' s organized , strategic and , according to martin , ineffective . there is a very interesting contrast between the traditional battle style and martin \\' s take - no - prisoners method . what drives martin to these supposedly unfair actions , are the originally brutal tactics of colonel tavington . played wonderfully by jason isaacs , tavington is the type who loves to glare down from his horse at civilians , who nervously avoid eye contact . this character is viciously evil ; he kills women and children and then laughs about it on the way home ; even his eyes are evil . his portrayal has sparked some controversy in britain , some claim that he falsely represents his countrymen as \" cowardly \" and \" sadistic . \" i disagree with this accusation . tavington does not represent his country ; his unnecessary executions shock his own colleagues and even anger his general . besides tavington , the redcoats remain stick figures that are neither glorified nor patronized . and stick figures make the easiest enemies in these kinds of movies - why give the audience a reason to love the bad guys ? heck , why not spend the entire film glossing up the good guys ? the patriot is three hours of fictional fireworks . with an action hero seeking revenge and a comic book villain ready to take him down , it \\' s a lethal weapon for the colonial times . god bless america ! and god bless the patriot !',\n",

       " ('ladies and gentlemen , 1997 \\' s independence day is here ! it \\' s title : starship troopers . and surprisingly , it is more entertaining than id4 . i realize that i gave last year \\' s sci - fi hit a 4 star rating , but i was under the spell of the powerful first hour . after subsequent viewings , i feel that independence day really wasn \\' t as great as it seemed -- though i still give it a positive review . starship troopers , on the other hand , has a mocking sense of humor , knowing perfectly well how ridiculous it may seem . as a result , starship troopers is a more exciting , energetic , and lively science fiction film . in fact , i probably could never get tired of watching this film . starship troopers is very reminiscient of star wars , another kick - ass space opera which reinvented the sci - fi drama altogether . while starship troopers is no star wars , it comes quite close , and the easiest assessment would be to call this film : \" the \\' star wars \\' of the 90s . \" am i being to generous to this film ? perhaps , but when a science fiction film comes along that can mix humor and romance , effectively , into the warring races . in essence , this is the science fiction equivolence of pulp fiction . the easiest way to write a review of this film would be to compare it to other science fiction films , and i may have to . starship troopers is not quite an original film persay , but director paul verhoeven gives the film a \" kick - the - aliens \\'- asses \" style . id4 had this same style , except it was forced , most likely the cause of will smith having a major role . this new \" star wars \" has a very simple , basic plot : mankind vs . an alien species . the alien species in question here is the bugs , a seemingly advanced civilization of arachnid - type insects . however , the underlying morals of starship troopers are fleshed out with deadly accuracy . sometimes the morals are buried by the bloody violence and intense action scenes , but during quiet moments , we realize that starship troopers has something to tell us about our civilization . more than likely , these morals will be overpowered and quickly forgotten by the time the movie ends . and they should be . i doubt verhoeven intended this film to be a thought - provoking film . this is an \" event \" film , but surprisingly above average . it is extremely refreshing to watch a sci - fi war film , and actually root for the human side ( something independence day never achieved ) . starship troopers begins with a satirical portrayal of those strange \" join the army \" ads . mixing a web - based interface , these summations of events are refreshingly original . stating , \" would you like to know more ? \" , these short news bulletins give the film an immediate sense of humor , and we know we should not take it seriously . however , we also witness the murder of several troopers in battle , in a gory , yet funny , way . after witnessing the slaughter , the film jumps back one year , to setup what we just saw . we are introduced to johnny rico ( casper van dien ) and carmen ibanez ( denise richards ) . rico flirts with carmen by sending her messages over computer terminals in school classrooms . however , carmen isn \\' t as interested in rico as she is in becoming a pilot . however , another classmate , dizzy flores ( dina meyer ) , has her eye on rico . unfortunately , rico isn \\' t interested in dizzy . this setup is rather cliched , as is the result of the setup , but it still is fun to watch . carmen signs up to become a starship trooper , and as a result , rico signs up . and as a result , dizzy signs up . everyone is assigned a certain position in the academy : carmen gets the pilot position she wanted , carl jenkins ( neil patrick harris ) , a psychic , gets a position in the training program , and rico is left in the lowest class of the starship troopers : the mobile infantry . the main story follows rico through his trials and relationships . in reality , i found myself watching a space version of \" melrose place , \" but with better special effects . an hour into the film , the war begins . a sense of tension grew in the audience i watched this film with . the first hour may have been a funny ( sometimes unintentionally ) setup , but we grew to care for the flat characters , because no matter how hard i tried not to like the characters , their gorgeous looks won me over ( call me superficial , if you must ) . following the training sessions , which had many dramas in themselves ( too many to mention here ) , the troopers are sent to war . the bugs live on the planet klendathu , a planet which consists of dirt and rock , and pretty much nothing else . many dramas occur during the war , until finally the troopers realize that their is something behind the bugs \\' attacks . a sort of intelligence which masterminds the defense . the troopers are ordered to locate the \" brain \" and capture it . i hopefully left the plot as vague as possible , because starship troopers is not about plot . it \\' s about special effects and gory violence . director verhoeven , most known for his nudie film showgirls and basic instinct , returns to his sci - fi days , which gave us good films like total recall . verhoeven likes to push the envelope of the mpaa , but despite all the violence , the comic book feel gives the film a sense of falsehood . starship troopers is extremely violent , with more gore than this year \\' s event horizon . the r rating is well deserved , and hopefully parents will not allow their 12 year old children to see it . my guess is that verhoeven \\' s target audience is the 18 to 25 male group . the film has a testosterone level off the charts , with chiseled men and beautiful women . despite these superficial elements , starship troopers also creates a world which made star wars so successful . while watching the film , we never second guess the character \\' s decisions because they seem perfectly clear . thankfully , no hero is punching aliens in the face , which gives the flat characters some depth for which we can identify with . the cast of starship troopers is quite annoying to begin with , but they soon grow on you . casper van dien has the chiseled facial features and tan skin which will make most girls swoon . to most guys , he will come across as artificial . fortunately , van dien is the worst of the cast , despite how hard he tries to come off as a real character . dina meyer does a much better job of fleshing out her character . her dizzy is extremely likeable . denise richards also does a good job , and her scenes are very well done . jake busey , gary busey \\' s son , gives a wonderfully funny performance , and provides one of the biggest laughs of the film . neil patrick harris ( remember , he was doogie howser ) is a little wooden , and slightly out of place with the rest of the cast . however , he does give a good performance . michael ironside gives the best performance of the film as the teacher with one arm . his performance rises above the rest . perhaps it is because his character is the most developed , but i think it is just ironside \\' s presence on screen . unfortunately , no particular cast member gives a star - making performance , which is too bad because the material here could have made many of the cast members stars . director verhoeven is the main star of the film . his direction is fast and unrelentless . he never slows down his pace , which makes for a wild ride . writer edward neumeier adapted the screenplay from the book by robert heinlein . the writing is usually very funny , and sometimes very corny . the dialogue is smart but not too smart . we aren \\' t required to know everything , but some plot holes are left unanswered . thankfully we are not intended to notice , and we really don \\' t ( except for one which lingered in my mind for quite a while ) . amazingly , with all the wars and romance going on , the screenplay manages to include some surprising governmental issues . in fact , these governmental changes seem fairly plausible , and this adds another layer to the story . the moral debate of the characters is quite surprising to find in a film of this genre , but what is even more surprising is the amount of humor included into all the carnage . i haven \\' t laughed this loud , even in some comedies . oh , and the special effects are first rate . starship troopers is rated r for graphic sci - fi violence and gore , and for some language and nudity . believe me when i say this : don \\' t take young kids to see this film . it is extremely violent . in fact , it is probably the most violent film out this year . however , if you are old enough ( over 17 ) to see it , starship troopers is guaranteed to entertain . it \\' s been a long time since i have cheered for the heros , while also cheering for the bad guys . and still , it is my dream to see a sci - fi film in which the alien race destroys mankind , and take over the world . now that would be entertaining !',\n",

       " ('remember back in the mid 1990s when crime and macabre movies were all the rage ? \" pulp fiction \" and \" fargo \" both managed to get oscar nominations for the best picture , and not surprisingly , a slew of rip - offs followed in the years thereafter . that fad seems to be over but here comes christopher mcquarrie writing and directing \" the way of the gun \" that at first glance looks like another of those wanna - be \\' s but upon closer inspection doesn \\' t look like anything comprehendable . it \\' s a crime story so wrapped up in its own little world it has a claustrophobic atmosphere - a film that won \\' t allow the story much room to expand outside its handful of characters and somehow still manages to turn a simple premise into something so complex its ridiculous . complexity should come as no surprise to anyone who \\' s familiar with mcquarrie , he wrote \" the usual suspects , \" which has become a cult favorite despite little critical acclaim . that film had a great story and was well directed but had such an elaborate , confusing screenplay it leaves many viewers scratching their heads after repeated viewings . you have to wonder if mcquarrie really had everything mapped out or if he was going for the hollywood idea that \" if it \\' s really confusing and about criminals and cops that makes it fascinating . \" with \" the way of the gun \" mcquarrie seems to be capitalizing on the same idea , but this time the story is far less commercial - a shame because maybe that would have helped . the film tells the story of two drifters with no ambition and barely a reason to live but aren \\' t hell - bent on death either ( played by ryan phillipie and benecio del toro ) . they get lucky when they hear about a scheme between a big - shot exec guy and his trophy wife who are going to have a baby through in vitro fertilization . they figure they can kidnap the surrogate mother ( played by juliette lewis ) and get a nice ransom . along the way we continually learn of the shady dealings between the exec , his wife , their hired goons and the \" bag man \" ( played by james caan - the only actor in the film who looks like he knows what he \\' s doing ) . the exec is some kind of money launderer so he obviously can \\' t call the authorities for help . his goons and the bag man are on the kidnappers \\' trail and each make different offers to get the mother back . the exec \\' s son is a doctor who also gets pulled into the fray and wants to make sure his patient is all right . meanwhile each of these characters has something hidden up their collective sleeves and the double - crosses , secret love affairs and torrid pasts come as no surprise even though little of it has any relevance at all . mcquarrie doesn \\' t know the meaning of the word simple . he seems to be more interested in showing us how clever he is than making a good movie . everything has to be complicated and confusing , so much so that it \\' s to the point of surrealism . nothing is what it seems in this reality , it \\' s one of those movies where you get dropped right into the middle of the criminal world and are expected to know most of the industry \\' s rules and regulations . every scene with caan \\' s character exemplifies this perfectly - the kidnappers already know who he is and even chat with him , getting into conversations about \" the business \" and how it works and we \\' re hardly given a clue as to what they \\' re talking about . these characters are probably supposed to be great criminal sketches but they \\' re more like ideas ripped - off from sketches found in david mamet \\' s trash . no one here really acts like a real person , and the story is even further removed from reality . it \\' s like a dream without any appeal . take the opening scene for example ; the phillipe and del toro characters are in a parking lot across the street from a bar or a club counting their money and stuff . they sit on a brand - new mercedes and the car alarm goes off , the owner is waiting in line and yells at them to get away from his car but they don \\' t move . the guy and his loud - mouth , potty - mouth girlfriend and about 20 other people cross the street and gang up on them . you \\' d think phillipe ? and del toro are ? going to pull out guns and scare them away but they don \\' t , instead phillipe throws one punch and the two get beat down by a mob . there \\' s a lot of things i didn \\' t understand about this scene : first of all the owner of the mercedes isn \\' t some yuppie or old rich snob , he \\' s like a hippie straight out of the 60s . secondly , the two main characters seem to believe that they can actually take on the mob unarmed . lastly , it serves no purpose in the long run because later in the film the two are packing more artillery than a small country \\' s army . if they were suicidal they wouldn \\' t have gone on the kidnapping job in the first place ( and where they get all those guns is never explained either ) . there \\' s a lot more i could pick apart about this film but that would be an exercise in futility . what it all comes down to is that nothing here is what it seems - which would be great if this movie were about pretty much any other story than what it is . absolutely none of the characters are likable or believable . and it \\' s all coated with a thin layer of black comedy which is good for a chuckle here and there but this film is definitely not a flat - out black comedy and its use of such seems like a desperate attempt to kill screen time . with any film you see , whether you like it or not , you can at least understand what the appeal was to it , why someone would want to make it and why someone would want to see it . i can \\' t say either for \" the way of the gun , \" because it has very little going for it and i can \\' t imagine anyone intelligently defending it .',\n",

       " ('when i first heard that disney \\' s next animated feature was going to be tarzan , i was almost horrified . i was worried that disney was going to make another hercules ( sorry , jerk - ules ) . that effort was too overloaded with comedy ( and the hero was too boastful and pompous to be considered a sympathetic hero ) , and , after viewing it to this day , i find it a disgrace for disney animation . when i saw the trailers , i was thinking \" hmm . . . this isn \\' t bad at all . this just might have potential . \" when i bought the soundtrack , i was really quite surprised at how different it sounded from most disney features . i have never really heard of phil collins , nor have i heard of mark mancina , so i was wondering , how would these two make this disney flick spin ? i was pleasantly surprised : the music is top - notch . phil collins \\' songs are terrific , percussion - heavy pieces of work that seem to break the formula for typical disney songs . the score from mark mancina was also neat ; it reminded me a bit of the lion king , but it was more original . so , the soundtrack wasn \\' t bad at all , considering it was by two people i am not familiar with . this film could be good . . . but will it be ? when i finally went to see it ( on opening day , as i tend to do with most disney animated features ) , my question was answered , in a complete turnabout of expectations for me : disney \\' s tarzan is surprisingly decent . the story starts out with tarzan \\' s parents surviving a shipwreck and finding a home on an island where apes live in peace . however , one day , a vicious leopard , sabor , attacks and kills tarzan \\' s parents , leaving him ( at this time , a baby ) alone - until kala of the apes rescues him . kala wants to raise the child as her own ( she lost hers previously to sabor ) , but her mate , kerchak is not too sure . \" it \\' s not our kind , \" he says . he agrees , though , to let her take care of little tarzan , but \" that doesn \\' t make him my son . \" tarzan grows up , vowing to be \" the best ape ever \" , but no matter how hard he tries or what he does ( at the guidance of his hilarious ape friend , terk ) , he just can \\' t convince kerchak that he is one of the apes , even when he defeats sabor in a battle . one day , a new animal shows up : humans . this is where jane comes into the picture . she is on an expedition with her father ( professor porter ) , and a despicable hunter ( clayton ) searching for gorillas . tarzan rescues her when she is chased by baboons , and soon they get to know each other . even though tarzan falls in love with jane , this causes things to go wrong . clayton tricks tarzan into taking him , jane , and porter to see the apes , who are convinced that he has betrayed them . worse , clayton has plotted to send the gorillas to london for money . will tarzan find out which family he belongs to and save the apes ? i \\' m not gonna tell you , sorry . you \\' re gonna have to see for yourself . and see it you should ; the animation is , as always , top notch , particularly when tarzan goes soaring through the trees ( read that , skateboarding ) . the deep canvas computer generated effect adds an authentic feeling to the jungle which tarzan lives in . in fact , it seems similar to the computer imagery / cel animation combination in rival disney animted films , such as fox \\' s anastasia and dreamworks \\' prince of egypt . could it be that disney was actually taking ideas from their rivals ? the casting is fairly good . tony goldwyn is emotionally believeable as tarzan ( and to my relief , the animators have succeeded in not making him another hercules . nicely done ) , and glenn close is wonderful as kala ( she has a beautiful singing voice , too , by the way ) . lance henrikson as kerchak somewhat reminds me of robby benson \\' s beast voice , which makes him all the more ferocious and gripping . minnie driver had me a little worried at first as the voice of jane . i thought she had the most annoying voice in the whole film ( when i first saw the trailers ) , but when i saw the film , i didn \\' t have a problem with her . i take back my insult on driver . it \\' s nice to hear nigel hawthorne do another voice for a disney animated feature ( he was fflewdurr flamm in disney \\' s most underrated classic , the black cauldron ) ; he is funny and delightful as professor porter . on the villiany side of the voices , brian blessed ( the guy who did boss nass in star wars : episode i - the phantom menace ) brings a pompous , and later on vicious , voice to the sinister clayton . he might not be the strongest character in the film ( he \\' s just a plain bad guy , nothing else ) , but blessed \\' s vocal work contributes greatly . but if there is any voice that i think steals the whole show , it should be rosie o \\' donnell , who is hilariously funny as terk . she also has a fiesty attitude ( \" i \\' m gonna kill ya ! \" she says , more than once ) . i almost sung along with her during one of the film \\' s best moments , where the apes make a mess of the human \\' s camp , via song , er , scatting \" shoo - be - doo , da - be - dah \" . i can see why she wanted to have a rock song for the film , she \\' s a good singer . not that she was the only funny character in the film , though . wayne knight ( who played stan in space jam ) gives a whimsically funny style to tantor , an elephant who is especially worried about stepping into \" un - sanitary \" water . ( thankfully , there is no real sound of flatuence - that would have killed the picture ) . the songs , as i said before , are decent , mostly sung by collins . this sets a new standard for disney animated films because for the first time , the characters do not sing . i tolerate musical numbers from characters a lot more than some other guys would , but i found this to be a nice change of pace . the story does have elements of comedy in it , but they also load it with strong dramatic touches , which makes this film far better than the unbelieveably uninspired hercules . if there is anything disappointing about tarzan , it might be the omission of the \\' n sync version of \" trashing the camp \" from the film . i heard it on the soundtrack , and wondered where it was going to be . i was upset that it wasn \\' t , because i had thought of taking a few friends of mine who like \\' n sync to see tarzan . oh , well . . . overall , i was enthralled with tarzan . i wouldn \\' t hold it high the way i do with mulan or the hunchback of notre dame ( my all - time favorite disney classics ) , but this film deserves a high place among disney \\' s greatest achievements . i give a nod to disney for following up their spectacular * * * * * masterpiece , mulan , with this great animated adaption of egar rice burrough \\' s tarzan .',\n",

       " ('some of my friends who went to live in usa complain about one thing - that country is very different from the one depicted in hollywood movies . that is especially true for those who end up somewhere in that unexplored land between los angeles and new york where they find , to their big surprise , that the majority of people vote republican , go to church every sunday and usually don \\' t tolerate liberal attitudes that are taken for granted in an average american film . such rude awakening , however , can happen in another direction - conservative people are sometimes forced to discover unpleasant truths about world they live in . something like that happens to jake van dorn ( george c . scott ) , successful grand rapids businessman who shares strong calvinist convictions with the rest of his community . one day his daughter kristen ( ilah davis ) disappears from calvinist youth convention in california . van dorn is worried because he doesn \\' t believe that his daughter would run from home . however , the truth delivered by private investigator andy mast ( peter boyle ) is even harder - kristen is spotted in cheap pornographic film . infuriated van dorn is unsatisfied with the way mast \\' s investigation is going , so he goes to los angeles to search for kristen himself . unfortunately , he lacks experience and the quest , that brought him to the utter depths of sex underworld , is fruitless . things change when he devises cunning plan and , while doing it , stumbles on sympathetic prostitute and part time porno actress nicky ( season hubley ) . almost two decades after its release , hardcore is mostly forgotten by critics and film scholars . it is a real shame , because very few movies in today \\' s hollywood would dare tackle controversial issues that writer and director paul schrader explored in his second directorial attempt . in late 1970s , it was totally different situation - films were expected to have mature , serious themes for the mature audience . for schrader this film was nice opportunity to expand the subplot of his previous work , taxi driver - one that deals with the great generational divide that tormented the american society in 1970s . on one side we have an old america that sticks to the puritan ideals of hard work and strict morals that made that country great . but that america is obviously unable to cope with the new challenges brought by the social turmoil in 1960s and , instead of facing them , prefers to live in rural , conservative cocoons . the new america , on the other hand , fares no better - ideals of the so - called \" sexual revolution \" , same as all other \" revolutions \" of the swinging sixties , degraded into exploitation and depravity . instead of being \" liberated \" , baby boomers are stuck with their own inability to cope with the newly discovered freedoms . schrader very cleverly brings the idea that those two americas , actually , aren \\' t so far away - nice example is a brilliant scene in which van dorn , already described as an authoritarian and paternalistic capitalist , meets sleazy porno producer ; the latter one also turns out to be authoritarian , paternalistic and very dedicated to this job . the difference between the two is simply in the line of work . many contemporary critics actually accused schrader of promoting conservative agenda . on the surface , it may look that way - audience is forced to sympathise with van dorn and his quest . in the first scenes , he is portrayed as nice family man who actually doesn \\' t deserve to experience parent \\' s worst nightmare . the scene in the porno cinema that reveals kristen \\' s fate is extremely cruel ; pain and humiliation , brought by oscar - winning actor george c . scott , is of such intensity , that the audience feels sorry for him and simply must support his agenda . van dorn is perhaps flawed , and the subtle hints lead to the unflattering truth at the end ; but the viewers simply know that his cause is just , and that prodigal daughter must be better off with her loving father than with the sleazy pornographers that only want to exploit her body . on the other hand , schrader , who grew up in an environment very much like van dorn \\' s ( his own parents wouldn \\' t allow him to watch movies until he was 18 ) , knows better and tries to bring another side of coin . even the people connected with sex underworld can show redeeming qualities - like nicky , who actually tries to improve her life , and sleazy detective who develops something like a conscience at the end . unfortunately , schrader fails to erase the impact of the shocking scene at the beginning , and his attempt to reconcile the opposing sides of america seems lost in somewhat clich ? d finale . the script is slightly flawed , and schrader as director doesn \\' t show too much originality - his style seems too influenced by techniques that scorsese used in taxi driver . apart from the scenes in grand rapids , those two films even look alike . but the content might be more than interesting for today \\' s viewer , especially those inspired by the current 70s revival . until boogie nights , no hollywood mainstream movie ever dared to explore the phenomenon of pornography in 1970s . hardcore , on the other hand , might serve as precious document , because it depicts sex film industry in the period often regarded as the golden age by connoisseurs - before the advent of video , when many of the porno filmmakers could afford to think of themselves as artists . the view of such age and the industry is very unflattering , though , but for the film whose main character takes time to explain calvinist doctrines to the audience , that shouldn \\' t be too surprising . anyway , despite some flaws , hardcore remains very interesting and powerful piece of cinema .',\n",

[ on a side note , gary sinise wins this week \\' s \" title ! \" award , as he \\' s the one who gets to awkwardly cram the name of the movie into one of his lines early in the proceedings . last week \\' s winner was natasha henstridge for the whole nine yards . ] how to take your bad idea and make things worse : include two or three plot twists that , instead of making the apparently stupidity of the plan seem suddenly intelligent , make the plan seem even more ridiculous and unlikely . this is a bad movie . and what \\' s worse is that , except for a few moments near the not - so - stunning conclusion as the preposterous is replaced by the ludicrously preposterous , reindeer games never really gives us the satisfaction of being laughably bad . if they \\' d done that much , at least i would have been entertained .',\n",

i shouldn \\' t have . this is a really good movie . no , this is a great movie . better yet , this is a phenomenal movie . there is a reason classics are invented : to make sure that people will always have great movies to aid them in their quest for living life . this is one of those films . it is a \" feel - good \" movie , something people complain a little too much about . but capra \\' s reworking of \" a christmas carol \" is the greatest christmas movie of all time . there , i \\' ve said it . i have to admit , the first time i saw this , i saw it with my family , including my 11 year old kid sister . they all loved it . they loved george , his wife , his troubles , and the beautiful ending . is it a little too sugar - coated ? maybe . no matter . this is a film that should be watched time and time again , with families around a coffee table , and eggnog on the plate . it is a film that just makes you feel good about life , family , and hope . it is the perfect christmas film , flaws and all . it is frank capra \\' s greatest acheivement , and that really does say a lot . for about 121 out of 129 minutes , this movie is flawless . the rest can be excused : no film is perfectly flawless . i can \\' t get over how much i love this movie , and how much you will , after watching it , digesting it , and sitting with your family , appreciating how special life really is .',\n",

' s screenplay doesn ' t always give them the best material . when howie reads big john a walt whitman poem , the moment feels a bit too precious . director michael cuesta lingers on an ecstatic reaction shot of big john , who may as well be hearing glenn gould performing bach ' s goldberg variations . it ' s too much . there are also some obvious dramatic contrivances involving big john ' s other boy toy ( walter masterson ) , jealous over the newbie . this plot thread predictably leads to violence . not content to be a haunting , observational portrait of teen alienation in a royally screwed up world ( like terry zwigoff ' s superb ghost world ) , cuesta lacks the confidence in his own work to end on an ambivalent note . it ' s typical of unimaginative cinema to wrap things up with a bullet , sparing the writers from actually having to come up with a complex , philosophical note . in this regard , l . i . e .

       " ('matthew broderick and high school comedy . the two terms have been practically inseparable since ferris buehler took the day off in 1986 . now it is 13 years later , and broderick has another high school comedy , election , to show the world . ferris buehler \\' s day off showed an educational setting that was similar to a pile of marshmallows . it was light , fluffy , tasty , and sparkling clean . but election is far different . this production is a dark , and frighteningly realistic one that does so much more than entertain for the 103 minutes it occupies ; it shocks as well . jim mcallister ( matthew broderick ) is the type of teacher that makes american high schools proud . he is a kind , caring , younger man who has built his life around carver high school . in turn , carver high school has provided a home for him . jim has won teacher of the year no less than three times in his 12 year span , and is a well respected social studies teacher among the student body . tracy flick ( reese witherspoon ) is an intelligent , outgoing , and , to quote the film , \" super nice \" young girl . she is involved in numerous extracurricular activities , always has her hand up first in class , and is extremely popular among most of the student body . so , it is a natural progression when she decides to run for school president . the metzler family is an extremely wealthy one . the father , dick ( holmes osborne ) , owns a cement company . the mother , jo ( jeanine jackson ) , is an ideal housewife . and the two children , paul ( chris klein ) and tammy ( jessica campbell ) , are both students at carver high school . paul was the quarterback of the football team before he injured himself , and is definitely a candidate for most popular person in school . tammy is a lesbian who , to say the least , is going through a period of self discovery . for reasons of revenge , hatred , and sexual envy , jim convinces paul to run against tracy for school president . he claims that in a democracy you need choices , and having tracy run unopposed creates a dictatorship of sorts . so paul agrees and the race is on . but then , in an effort to spite the two candidates , tammy announces that she is running as well . her campaign is straightforward : people only run to put it on their college applications , then they do nothing . well , \" i don \\' t even want to go to college , \" she says . in election , there are no \" good guys \" . almost everyone has their own agenda . no matter how deeply hidden , the production digs it up and exploits it for the audience . tracy is the type of person that you remember from high school . she is the girl that would be labeled \" most likely to achieve anything she wants \" in the yearbook , and everyone secretly envied her because of that . jim is a teacher that takes the trust that students give him as a privilege , and uses it to his own amoral advantage . everyone , including the principal , a former teacher , all the candidates , and even paul \\' s girlfriend are two sided characters . that is much of this film \\' s beauty , it doesn \\' t have the typical good guys that hollywood likes , instead it is a realistic portrayal of the real world , specializing in revealing the type of sexual perversions that people usually keep to themselves . matthew broderick couldn \\' t have been any more perfect for this role . his character is often similar bill murray \\' s award winning role in the 1998 film , rushmore . of the two acting jobs , broderick \\' s is far superior . but even he is overshadowed by the young reese witherspoon . the hatred that she causes the audience to develop towards her , is simply indescribable . broderick and witherspoon are simply at their best when they are playing off each other in various scenes . one such moment occurs when she approaches him in his car as he is leaving school one day . you can see her self pride in her eyes as she presents him a list of signatures , making her an eligible candidate . and his subtle disgust with her is apparent , although he tries to mask it between the lines and attempts to put on a happy face . the supporting cast is one with little hollywood experience . but that is far from apparent as everyone takes control of their part . however , the real treat is jessica campbell in her confused role as a young homosexual girl . this is never more apparent than the scene where she delivers her speech announcing her so - called platform for presidency . she is just marvelous as her hatred towards what she thinks to be an unjust system is expressed . if ferris buehler made you feel good about american high schools , and gave you an innocent laugh or two , then the movie achieved its goal . but don \\' t you dare think that election \\' s goals are similar . it is just as real in its portrayal of high school , as its characters are in the real world . there certainly is no pile of marshmallows here .',\n",

( good call - now we can put all our drooling efforts into only the most deserving of characters ) . right off the bat , rico becomes the star of the show , far surpassing all the other soldiers and becoming squadron leader in a short period of time . but a horrific accident during a standard training exercise ( which follows all to closely to his breakup with carmen ) leaves rico ready to call it quits . with his bags packed and his civilian clothes back on , johnny is ready to walk off base and catch the next flight home . well sorry , rico suave , but there \\' s no place like home , especially after gigantic alien insects have destroyed it . that \\' s right , the planet is being attacked by a colony of arachnid - like alien beings that a can of raid just isn \\' t going to destroy . with a sudden change of heart ( and clothes ) , rico is back in the game , following his fellow starship troopers off to fight a mean group of daddy long legs . what starship troopers really is , is a spoof of all that it even remotely touches on - the soap opera like love affairs of high school , the love for sci - fi and thirst for gore shared by this same age group , etc . nothing is taken seriously . it \\' s almost as much a satire on young adults as clueless , but with its sly and futuristic approach , it \\' s not as recognizably so . it \\' s a spoof so subtle that many won \\' t recognize the spoofery . if you deem this as sci - fi / action , you \\' re wrong . it \\' s sci - fi / action / comedy , with the comedy being on the level of such cult favorites as evil dead 2 . starship troopers just may be on the road to cult status as well . gore is a factor heavily brought up in reviews of this film , but the gore , too , is meant to be cheesy . yes , it \\' s graphic , but it \\' s also brutally phony , and that \\' s what makes it such great fun to watch . not since the old \" mr . bill \" skits on \" saturday night live \" has torture and mutilation been such a joy to watch . people were laughing out loud every time a body was severed in half or a head was viciously decapitated . perhaps it brings back fond memories of the severities we inflicted upon our sisters \\' barbie dolls as young children . with the actors resembling ken and barbie so closely , it \\' s a good chance this is the case , whether we \\' re fully aware of it or not . starship troopers has it \\' s slow parts , but it \\' s truly an alternative to your typical sci - fi / action flick or lame juvenile comedy . aside from the intentionally cheesy gore , the special effects are quite astounding . when the spaceship passes a meteor , it \\' s quite an awesome spectacle , visually crisp and captivating . if you \\' re looking for brainless fun , this is the epitome of your search . a beautiful cast , awesome special effects , fast - paced action , campy acting , and a whole lot of gore . this is brainless heaven . just remember not to think .',\n",

       " ('there are times when the success of a particular film depends entirely on one actor \\' s effort . often a single performance can turn what might have been a rather mediocre movie into something worthwhile . when one of these comes along , i usually try to think about how many other people put work into the movie , that there is no way one person could possible carry the entire project on his shoulders . but sometimes there is simply no other explanation , and such is the case with \" the hurricane . \" this biopic about falsely convicted boxer rubin \" hurricane \" carter would normally be called \" norman jewison \\' s \\' the hurricane , \\' \" as per the tradition of referring to a film \" belonging \" to a director . but though he does decent work , jewison cannot claim ownership of \" the hurricane , \" because there is one reason this film works at all , and his name is denzel washington . washington plays carter , a boxer who in 1967 was convicted of a late - night shooting in a bar . jailed for 20 years , he maintained that he had never committed the crimes , but remained in jail after a second trial and countless appeals . the situation changed when a group of canadians moved to washington and worked on freeing carter . through the efforts of that group and carter \\' s lawyers , he was eventually freed when their case was heard in federal court and the judge ruled that rubin carter had been unfairly convicted . the film details carter \\' s childhood , which had him in and out of jail because of the efforts of a racist cop ( dan hedaya ) . when he finally got out of prison for good , carter became a rising star as a middleweight pro boxer , seemingly having his career on track , until the police framed him for multiple homicide . despite the efforts of political activists and celebrities , he remained imprisoned . flash forward to 1983 , when lesra ( vicellous reon shannon ) a young african - american boy , living with a group of canadian tutors , reads the book carter wrote while in prison . the book , entitled \" the sixteenth round , \" opens young lesra \\' s eyes to the injustice that was carter \\' s life , and he vows to help free the incarcerated boxer . lesra convinces his canadian friends ( deborah unger , liev schreiber , john hannah ) to work with him towards his goal . \" the hurricane \" leans on denzel washington . he must carry virtually every scene by sheer force of will , and he does so brilliantly . it \\' s probably accurate to say that washington does not embody rubin carter , because he plays a character far stronger and nobler than any real person could hope to be . it would perhaps be more accurate to say that washington embodies the character of rubin carter -- a fictional personality invented solely for the film . the actor \\' s work is masterful ; washington throws himself into every moment , refusing to keep the audience at arm \\' s length . we feel everything he feels : the humiliation of having to return to prison after fighting so hard to make something of his life , the pain of having to order his wife to give up the fight , and the utter despair he feels when coming to the conclusion that all hope is lost . washington \\' s is a performance of weight and emotional depth . he doesn \\' t merely play angry , happy , or sad ; he feels it at the deepest level . his work is masterful , and for half of this film i realized that the scene i was watching would not have been nearly as affecting as it was if it had been in the hands of another actor . norman jewison directs the film , doing a reasonably good job of pacing and shot selection . \" the hurricane \" moves quickly , with no scene drawn out much further than necessary and the narrative galloping along nicely . jewison handles his multiple flashbacks well ; the audience is always aware of just what the time and place of each scene is , and nothing is terribly confusing . his boxing scenes , constructed with clear inspiration from \" raging bull , \" get inside the action very well , and they are believable as real sports footage . jewison puts together a particularly nice scene by utilizing a pretty cool trick : carter is sent to solitary confinement for 90 days when he refuses to wear a prison uniform , and jewison , assisted by some wonderful acting from a game washington , shows how carter gradually starts to lose his mind during the constant solitude , and eventually we get three rubin carters arguing with each other in one cell . jewison \\' s best achievement in \" the hurricane \" is succeeding at showing how carter becomes an embittered man during his hard - knock life , and how he is able to break out of that bitterness and learn to trust people again . sadly , though , the film \\' s chief failures lie with the screenplay , as with most of the good - but - not - great efforts to round the pike this winter . there is much to interest a viewer in \" the hurricane , \" but it seems that every time the film gets a chance to take the most clich ? d route possible , it does . take a look at the supporting characters , for example , who are drawn up as either entirely good or entirely evil . carter and lesra ( played nicely by shannon , who deserves credit ) are the only real people here ; everyone else is a stereotype . the canadians are good . the cops are bad . the canadians spend most of their time dolefully grinning at each other in their lovey - dovey commune ( and it is a commune , despite the film \\' s failure to make that clear ) , while every racist cop ( especially dan hedaya \\' s ) melts in out of the shadows and glowers at every black person that enters the room . much of the dialogue comes off as rather hokey ( \" hate put me in prison . love \\' s gonna bust me out . \" ) , and the big courtroom climax during which everyone gets to make an impassioned speech could have been lifted from a made - for - tv lifetime special . it \\' s too bad . the cast is game , the director does his job , and the subject matter is interesting , but the script takes the safer , slightly more boring route far too often . i wanted a real reason for the cop to hold a grudge against carter other than \" he \\' s a racist pig . \" i wanted more evidence that these canadians are real people with faults and virtues instead of a bunch of saintly crusaders looking for justice . in short , i wanted to see the film through a less distorted lens . criticism has been levied against the liberties \" the hurricane \" takes with the truth of what really happened to carter , and much of it is deserved . for example , the film gives us a boxing scene showing carter pummeling defending champ joey giardello , only to be screwed by the judges , who ruled giardello the winner . most accounts of the fight , however , have carter losing fairly . furthermore , much of carter \\' s criminal past is conveniently left out of the film , and just why he was convicted again in his second trial is never really explained . of course , \" the hurricane \" works mainly as a fable , so digressions from the truth can be excused at least partially , but even dismissing such issues don \\' t remove one fact : \" the hurricane \" is a highly flawed film . only one actor could have made a schmaltzy , predictable picture like this work as well as it does , and it \\' s a good thing \" the hurricane \" has that actor . carter has been quoted as saying , \" denzel washington is making me look good , \" but he \\' s not the only one . washington makes this film look good . denzel washington \\' s \" the hurricane . \" sounds pretty good to me .',\n",

       " (\"50 ' s ` aliens vs . earth ' idea revamped ! if you have been following the movie news over the net , you could not have escaped the hype over id4 . it promises to be the summer film of the year and it has all the elements necessary . id4 opened in the us on 2nd of july , and up till now , only after a week of release , it has nearly touched the us $ 100 million mark , a phenomenon last observed when jurassic park was released back in 1993 . the premise of the movie is disgustingly simple : earth defends itself against the aliens , a typical and highly popular 50 ' s hollywood theme which manifested itself in many films produced in that era . the movie opens via star wars , however unoriginal it may be , it worked . the aliens have sent a large mother ship ( supposedly to be 1 / 4 size of the moon ) to attack earth by deploying attack ships 15 miles in radius to all the major cities on earth . the us president ( pullman ) does not know of the aliens ' intention but soon finds out when david ( goldblum ) a scientist , discovers that the aliens are counting down to a synchronised attack on all the major cities . capt . hiller ( smith ) , a hot - shot f - 18 pilot are one of the hundreds assigned to take out the hovering alien attack ship over washington dc . his squadron came under heavy alien fire after discovering that their weapons were useless against the invaders , he crash lands after a spectacular 1 - on - 1 chase over the grand canyon , one of the many highlights of the movie . id4 features many characters and we are shown the impact on them as the story progresses . acting on the whole was ok although i thought that bill pullman was a bit unsuitable for the president role but he did make a very rousing speech before sending his troops into battle ( do we smell a bit of braveheart here ? ? ) . no prizes for guessing how id4 ends , its just plain obvious . id4 borrows heavily from star wars , return of the jedi , alien and in some parts of the movie , i could even sense a bit of x - files on screen . if i were to critically review this movie , id4 is full of plot holes , corny dialogue , and ridiculously dumb aliens . however below that wafer - thin plot and on - screen flaws , id4 scored well in playing with the appealing idea of the entire world giving up their petty differences to unite themselves as one force against the alien invasion . an idea which will have the audience strongly rooting for the united front throughout the movie , thus maintaining a screen - viewer interaction that virtually render any holes in the movie acceptable , no matter how ridiculous . id4 was produced under a modest budget of us $ 68 million , a film of such magnitude would have easily been another waterworld but director roland emmerich ( universal soldier , stargate ) and producer dean devlin assembled a team which did their own special effects rather than commissioning it to ilm or any other special effects company . some of the effects are not too good but most of it are very believable , especially the epic standoff between 150 f - 18 ' s and 250 alien saucers , reminiscence of the classic space battle featured in return of the jedi . id4 is a movie for all . though there are many explosions and implied deaths , there are no gory scenes of human destruction , thus young kids should be able to take it . sit back and don ' t be too critical , chances are you will be absorbed into the movie just as i was . if you are not planning to watch any movies this year , please , at least make time for this one . this film is best watched on the big - screen .\",\n",

( aside : in the wake of columbine , craven toned down the violence significantly for scream 3 - why the sanctimony , when scream and scream 2 are still readily available on video store shelves ? ) finally , marco beltrami \\' s music cues the suspense too blatantly - do you recall the tense chase at the college radio station in scream 2 ? it \\' s mostly silent . sting notes are a whole lot more effective if they spring from nowhere ; here , they act as the crescendos of an incessantly nerve - jangling score . i look at scream 3 as coming from an alternative universe , the same place that birthed the godfather part iii and superman iii - woefully out of synch with its prequels , scream 3 is a nightmare instead of nightmarish , and will likely put the horror genre back in mothballs . the film unintentionally follows the unspoken rule of a trilogy to a t : ? part three must disappoint \\' .',\n",

for every detail left in , dozens are only hinted at . i could probably go on all day , but i won \\' t ; suffice it to say that many of these minor details could have been the highlight of the movie . some of my favorites are kiki \\' s relationship with the baker \\' s husband : although he \\' s quiet , never shown speaking to kiki throughout the movie , and he initially scares her , his kindness wins her friendship . in the garage of a deliveree \\' s house can be found a vintage model t . two old ladies have a relationship evolving from master - servant to friend - friend . such details gives the impression that the beauty shown in the movie is only the tip of the iceberg . added on top of this is a lesson on the importance of self - worth . kiki initially seems to derive much of her self - worth from the beauty of her surroundings and the people around her , but an encounter with a rude girl crashes down her bewonderment , making her question the importance of such beauty . this causes kiki to lose faith in herself . however , kiki comes to realize not only the beauty of her surroundings , but the innate beauty inside her . seeing kiki regain faith in herself is marvelous , and the principal device used to do it is so sublime that i don \\' t even want to hint at it . the ending of the movie has a subtle charm combined with a sense of awe and , ironically , the most disney - esque moment i \\' ve ever seen ; if you don \\' t hold your breath in wonder you might want to get medical attention . the movie steers free of many of the disney conventions : there is no violence , however cartoonish , no song - and - dance number , and kiki \\' s pet cat jiji is more a friend than a comedic sidekick , although jiji is given many funny lines and scenes . however , i would be surprised if disney doesn \\' t give jiji more jokes , or at least the voice of some comedian . refreshingly enough , the moral lesson of the movie is not self - contradicted , a habit disney movies have gotten into . \" beauty and the beast \" \\' s beautiful belle , for instance , learned that beauty was derived from a person \\' s inside , and was then rewarded by having the beast turn into a handsome prince in snazzy clothing . kiki , on the other hand , learns to separate her wardrobe from her self - image , and nothing more is made of her early desires for better clothing than illustrating her increased maturity at the end of the film . another difference with disney movies is in the style of animation for \" kiki \\' s delivery service \" : not as colorful and dynamic as disney animation can be , but with a greater attention to realism and detail , it fits the movie to a t . this is particularly true with scenes of kiki \\' s flights . the extreme realism of the birds in flight near kiki is magnificent to behold , and helps these scenes capture the wonder of flight better than any other film i \\' ve ever seen . i \\' m not sure when or how this movie will be released in the united states . disney tentatively plans a theater release of \" monoko hime \" shortly following the summer \\' 97 japanese release , and should start releasing the other ghibli films after that . i \\' d guess that some will be released on video and some will be theatrically released in peak seasons with no competing disney release . although the wait is unfortunate , it \\' s good to know that it \\' s being released at all , for \" kiki \\' s delivery service \" is definitely a movie worthy of widespread promotion and release . watch this movie . along with \" man bites dog , \" and perhaps something by woody allen , this is the best movie i \\' ve ever seen .',\n",

       " ('i \\' m not quite sure what to say about mars attacks ! , which is obviously the work of a deranged genius . when tim burton \\' s twisted alien invasion comedy really works , it \\' s breathtaking and hilarious in equal measure . and when it doesn \\' t work , it \\' s just dull . i \\' m not even sure it works more often than it doesn \\' t , but where it counts -- that is , when this gleefully evil invading force from the red planet gets down to the business of blasting us to kingdom come -- mars attacks ! is brilliant . mars attacks ! is based on a rather unsavory series of trading cards released by topps in the 1950s , and it takes its cues from the same sources as this summer \\' s independence day -- old alien invasion flicks , disaster movies , and big - budget special effects extravaganzas . but unlike independence day , which was a painfully middle - of - the - road appeal to the hearts , minds and wallets of america , mars attacks ! has a fully developed and very personal sense of wonder about it . the big difference is that while independence day celebrated the resilience of human beings , mars attacks ! portrays us as the greedy and hapless schmucks that we are . the title sequence is just splendid -- an incredible swarm of flying saucers rises out of the canals of the red planet and then storms earthward through the solar system in formation . the spinning metal saucers are dead ringers for the invading forces of movies past , and their first appearance on the big screen in combination with danny elfman \\' s thundering , theremin - driven score is absolutely jaw - dropping . it \\' s so overwhelming that , i swear to you , i had trouble breathing . the movie lays low for the next 40 minutes . we get a glimpse of the alien leader , resplendent in a purple - sequined cape , when a television message is broadcast to the people of the world -- naturally , the only way to communicate with earthlings is to preempt our regularly scheduled programming . but mostly , the first act is spent developing characters , setting up mildly comic situations , and drawing a quirky but dishearteningly drab picture of america according to tim burton . it \\' s a good thing that the most compelling personality in the movie belongs to the aliens , because burton \\' s just not interested in making more than caricatures out of his human stars . anyone who comes to mars attacks ! expecting to see a lot of one favorite actor is bound to be disappointed -- with few exceptions , these characters are dispatched as the film progresses . jack nicholson is a lot of fun as the president of the united states but fizzles as a sleazy las vegas hotel developer . rod steiger does an amusing enough take on dr . strangelove \\' s buck turgidson , glenn close brings some star power to the role of the first lady , and martin short is a presidential aide who meets the martians in the white house \\' s \" kennedy room , \" a secluded nook where he unwittingly tries to seduce an alien dressed up as a big - haired , pointy - breasted sexpot ( lisa marie , the burton flame who played vampira in ed wood ) -- in an earlier scene , it \\' s made clear that the aliens studied human sexuality in the pages of an old issue of playboy . sarah jessica parker hosts her own tv show and michael j . fox is her newsman husband . the octogenarian sylvia sidney has a funny part as the old woman who cackles , \" they blew up congress ! \" and plays a decisive role in the defeat of the alien menace . jim brown and tom jones are the film \\' s vegas - based heroes , and director barbet schroeder ( reversal of fortune ) has a funny cameo as the unfortunate french president . also on hand and underutilized are annette bening , pierce brosnan , pam grier , lukas haas and natalie portman ( the latter two also show up in woody allen \\' s everyone says i love you ) . the real stars , of course , are the computer - generated martians , and they \\' re fantastic . with bare brains glistening atop their grinning skull - faces , round egg - eyes with red pupils darting this way and that , these animated invaders are malevolence incarnate -- joe dante \\' s gremlins are the closest equivalent in recent memory , but burton \\' s little monsters are more inventive . the film \\' s raison d \\' etre are the scenes of crimes against mankind -- the most famous monuments of the world crumble under the alien assault , easter island is turned into a bowling alley , and the nasty little buggers perform hideous medical experiments on captured humans . the sheer level of mayhem is staggering , especially when the aliens make their first attack , blasting human beings into iridescent skeletons . parents are urged to pay special attention to the pg - 13 rating -- it \\' s earned . the special effects vary from charming to astonishing to deliciously cheesy , and at least a couple of shots of mass destruction seem to have been engineered specifically in response to independence day , although mars attacks ! was in production long before that film \\' s release . cinematographer peter suschitzky , who makes the most of wynn thomas \\' s wildly imaginative production design ( thomas helped define the spike lee style ) , actually took time off from his mars attacks ! regimen to shoot crash for david cronenberg . cronenberg \\' s movie will almost certainly be more somber -- it won \\' t be released in the u . s . until early next year -- but mars attacks ! is surely a similarly elegant nightmare . this is not a nice movie . ( and which studio executive was duped into giving burton $ 70 million to make it ? ) by setting the film \\' s final scenes in the nearly empty , holocaust - ravaged america that independence day conveniently avoided , burton \\' s invasion epic suggests that the world we \\' ve got may not be worth saving until many of the people on it are dead . the victims of his invasion are naive , greedy , or disastrously self - absorbed -- and a good thing , too , since the movie \\' s wicked charm is dependent on our ability to take this invasion partly as a wish - fulfillment fantasy . the surviving cast members are the innocents and the entertainers , who triumph by determining that the alien invaders -- the ultimate elitists -- are actually susceptible to the kitschiest strains of american pop culture . ultimately , this messy masterpiece is the year \\' s funniest comedy and a weird , winking affirmation of the power of the people .',\n",

       " (\"in 1912 , a ship set sail on her maiden voyage across the atlantic for america . this ship was built to be the largest ship in the world , and she was . she was also build to be one of the most luxurious , and that she was . finally , she was built to be unsinkable and that unfortunately she was not . to get a ticket for this voyage you either : spent a life ' s savings to get to america to start life anew , were part of the upper class and had the money to spare , or finally were lucky enough to have a full house in a poker match by the docks like jack dawson . jack dawson makes the trip , and happens to be at the right place at the right time . rose dewitt bukater , a first class passenger , climbs the railings at the aft of the ship with thoughts of jumping . thus is started a tale of romance and intrigue , and a tale of death and tragedy . . . this movie is about a tragic event that took place a great many years ago , an even that should not be taken lightly as any other bit of historical trivia . the movie titanic shows what happened , maybe not with a 100 % degree of accuracy , but it still shows it very realisticaly . now the titanic is both a story on its own and a backdrop for a story . it serves as both admirably , brining forth an interesting story that although simple in its most simple premise is very captivating . this movie is very emotional simply because of what it is , but that alone is not enough . the story is brought out with a certain style that makes is so much more emotional and so much more effective . movies such as this will not be forgotten all too quickly and unfortunately then are not something that is produced by hollywood with any great frequency . the attention to detail that was paid is remarkable . the whole premise for the telling of the story is interesting , with the showing of brand new footage from the wreck of the titanic adding much flavor to an already good movie . part of the magical chemistry behind this story is the acting , and for this movie its extremely good acting from the whole cast . the performances put in by the main stars is something to be admired . the characters were played out so memorably that both leonardo dicaprip and kate winslet should receive at the least nominations for their roles . looking at the acting done in the movie it seems as if they aren ' t acting but are actually the characters in the movie . the casting for the movie could really have been better , in my humble opinion that is . one character that will most likely not be mentioned by any other review or commentary about this film is that of the ship itself . yes , you read correctly , the ship is a character . how is the titanic a character ? you ask well simple , a ship had a certain character about it and as most sailors and boats men will tell you . this character is everything about the ship from its specifications to its luxuries and the titanic was no stranger to this . mr . cameron brings the ship to life in an almost literal sense . all this adds to the movie in a certain way that most hollywood productions cant seem to grasp . now , to produce the effect that i mentioned above and to sink the ship itself are feats that are accomplished by special effects wizards . the effects in this movie range from marvelous costumes to beautifully rendered scenes of the ships sinking . in some respects you cannot tell that the effects are there , you simply think that what you see is what happened or what is happening ( if your imagination is good ) . the technical wizardry done in this movie is just spectacular and actually getting new footage from the wreck of the titanic is unique . the movie will leave you amazed at the effects , and that is a feat since there is no monsters or aliens in this movie , just humans and an oversized ship . the movie will amaze you and it will pull on your emotions , the theater that i went to had a few people leaving with tears in their eyes . now that is not a feat accomplished by most movies , now the fact that the tragedy actually occurred is brought home with something of a punch , i wont spoil the ending and say what happens regardless it is an interesting movie from beginning to the very end . the historical value of this movie is quite high , and honestly is something that should be watched for the sake of seeing it and seeing the tragedy , for it is extremely well done . the method of telling the story is also good , maybe not totally unique but effective none the less . regardless of anything mentioned above this movie is a grandiose production and the sheer size of the project undertaken is something to be marveled at . the simple fact that the movie is smashingly successful at what it aims to achieve is just astonishing . if you get the chance to see this movie go ! ! ! it might not be the best movie in the world . . but it ranks fairly highly and is well worth the time spent watching it . during none of the 3 hours and 13 minutes of the movie are you bored nor does your attention wane from the movie .\",\n",

       " ('\" jaws \" is a rare film that grabs your attention before it shows you a single image on screen . the movie opens with blackness , and only distant , alien - like underwater sounds . then it comes , the first ominous bars of composer john williams \\' now infamous score . dah - dum . from there , director steven spielberg wastes no time , taking us into the water on a midnight swim with a beautiful girl that turns deadly . right away he lets us know how vulnerable we all are floating in the ocean , and once \" jaws \" has attacked , it never relinquishes its grip . perhaps what is most outstanding about \" jaws \" is how spielberg builds the movie . he works it like a theatrical production , with a first act and a second act . unlike so many modern filmmakers , he has a great deal of restraint , and refuses to show us the shark until the middle of the second act . until then , he merely suggests its presence with creepy , subjective underwater shots and williams \\' music . he \\' s building the tension bit by bit , so when it comes time for the climax , the shark \\' s arrival is truly terrifying . he doesn \\' t let us get bored with the imagery . the first act opens with police chief martin brody ( roy scheider ) , a new york cop who has taken an easy , peaceful job running the police station on amity island , a fictitious new england resort town where there hasn \\' t been a murder or a gun fired in 25 years . the island is shaken up by several vicious great white shark attacks right before the fourth of july , and the mayor , larry vaughn ( murray hamilton ) , doesn \\' t want to shut down the beaches because the island is reliant on summer tourist money . brody is joined by matt hooper ( richard dreyfuss ) , a young , ambitious shark expert from the marine institute . hooper is as fascinated by the shark as he is determined to help brody stop it -- his knowledge about the exact workings of the shark ( \" it \\' s a perfect engine , an eating machine \" ) make it that much more terrifying . when vaughn finally relents , hooper and brody join a crusty old shark killer named quint ( robert shaw ) on his decrepit boat , the orca , to search for the shark . the entire second act takes place on the orca as the three men hunt the shark , and inevitably , are hunted by it . \" jaws \" is a thriller with a keen sense of humor and an incredible sense of pacing , tension , and horror . it is like ten movies all rolled into one , and it \\' s no wonder it took america by storm in the summer of 1975 , taking in enough money to crown it the box office champ of all time ( until it was unceremoniously dethroned in 1977 by \" star wars \" ) . even today , fascination with this film is on par with hitchcock \\' s \" psycho , \" and it never seems to age . although grand new technology exists that makes the technical sequences , including several mechanical sharks , obsolete , none of it could improve the film because it only would lead to overkill . the technical limitations faced by spielberg in 1975 may have actually produced a better film because it forced him to rely on traditional cinematic elements like pacing , characterization , sharp editing , and creative photography , instead of simply dousing the audience with digital shark effects . scheider , dreyfuss , and shaw were known actors at the time \" jaws \" was made , but none of them had the draw of a robert redford or paul newman . nevertheless , this film guaranteed them all successful careers because each gave an outstanding performance and refused to be overshadowed by the shark . scheider hits just the right notes as a sympathetic husband and father caught in the political quagmire of doing what \\' s right and going against the entire town . \" it \\' s your first summer here , you know , \" mayor vaughn warns him . dreyfuss , who had previously been seen in \" american graffiti \" ( 1973 ) and \" the apprenticeship of duddy kravitz \" ( 1974 ) gives a surprisingly mature , complex performance for someone who had literally only played kids and teenagers . however , most outstanding is the gnarled performance by robert shaw as the movie \\' s captain ahab , a performance sorely overlooked by the academy awards . bordering of parody , shaw plays quint as a grizzled old loner whose machismo borders on masochism . he \\' s slightly deranged , and shaw \\' s performance is almost a caricature . however , there is one scene late in the film , when he and brody and hooper are below deck on the orca comparing scars . quint is drawn into telling the story of his experiences aboard the u . s . s . indianapolis , a navy ship in world war ii that was sunk by the japanese . his tale of floating in the water for more than a week with over 1 , 000 other men while swarms of sharks slowly devoured them them is actually more hair - raising than anything spielberg put on screen . shaw delivers the story in one long take , and it is the best acting in the film . of course , we can \\' t leave out the shark itself ; with its black eyes , endless rows of teeth , and insatiable urge to eat , it is basically the epitome of all mankind \\' s fears about what is unknown and threatening in nature . a shark is such a perfect nemesis it is real -- having survived sinch the dinosaurs , great whites do exist , they can be as large as the shark in \" jaws , \" and they are a threat . every one of spielberg \\' s subjective underwater shots makes us feel queasy because lets us see how we look to the shark : a bunch of writihing , dangling , completely unprotected legs just ready to be chomped into . the shark in \" jaws \" was actually a combination of actual footage and five different mechanical sharks ( all nicknamed \" bruce \" by the crew ) built to be shot from different angles . many have forgotten , but \" jaws \" was a sort of precursor to \" waterworld \" ( 1995 ) , a movie \\' s who soggy production and cost overruns had universal studios worried about a bomb . but , as we can see now , spielberg overcame all the obstacles , and delivered one of the finest primal scare - thrillers ever to come out of hollywood .',\n",

       " ('armageddon , in itself , symbolizes everything that is wrong in modern filmmaking . stories have been replaced with special effects ; character development gets overshadowed by bad dialogue ; plotting consists of a bunch of shit getting blown up . armageddon is as stupid , as loud and as shallow as any movie you \\' ll see come out this summer , or maybe even any other summer . but i loved every freaking minute of it . believe me , i \\' m just as shocked as you are . hell , i don \\' t even know why i went to see it in the first place . the previews were so annoying that i predicted this was going to be the worst film of the year , or at least in the running . i \\' m sorry , but \" somebody dial 911 ! ! ! \" isn \\' t quite the tagging that \\' s going to sell a movie . it isn \\' t too wise either to market the film using the movie \\' s stupidest lines ( \" beam me up scotty \" - yeah , that sure is great writing . . . ) . i mean , let \\' s face it ; armageddon \\' s previews rival the truman show \\' s as being some of the worst of the year . neither of them even come close to doing their respective films justice . of course , you all know the story . when the earth is threatened with total annihilation via an asteroid the size of texas , nasa calls in the us \\' s top oil drillers ( ! ) to go into space ( ! ) and implant a nuclear device eight - hundred and someodd feet into the asteroid ( ! ) . in the coarse of all this mayhem , we are introduced to some interesting - and not so interesting - characters . belonging to the former group is rockhound ( steve buscemi ) , a horny little womanizing genius who \\' s always full of wisecracks , even when flying into space at a huge amount of g \\' s . also , there \\' s the always cool - as - hell billy bob thornton as dan truman , the bigwig at nasa who recruits all the drillers . he kind of reminded me of ed harris in apollo 13 , only without the intensity and great lines to deliver . then on the flip side of the coin is the tired , contrived character of harry stamper ( bruce willis , who does the whole movie employing with annoying accent i can \\' t quite place ) , the leader of the pack as well as liv tyler and ben affleck as the token lovers you must have in any summer movie . basically , that \\' s about it . as i said , this is hardly a film about plot . it \\' s another summer blockbuster with plot points that are beyond unbelievable and dialogue and characters that are mostly completely wooden . case in point : nasa doesn \\' t know that there is even an asteroid on it \\' s way until eighteen days before impact - huh ? another example : at one point in the movie , two children are playing with toy space shuttles in front of a poster of kennedy . how pretentious is that ? ? ? ! ! ! want another one ? okay ; before the oil drillers blast off into space , one of them starts singing \" leaving on a jet plane \" , and soon , all the rest join in . did michael bay attend the school of sappy filmmaking before he made this picture ? but naturally , all this sappiness , melodrama and special effects accumulate to one bitchin \\' time at the movies . and don \\' t get me wrong - despite all of the things i found wrong with armageddon , i still very much enjoyed it . so even if you don \\' t win one of mcdonald \\' s free tickets , it \\' s still definitely worth checking out .',\n",

       " (\"buffalo ? 66 is a very rarely known movie that stars vincent gallo and christina ricci . gallo plays a very troubled man , who was sent to jail for gambling . once out of jail , he must visit his parents , who he told he was married . the truth is he isn ' t married . to try to impress them , he kidnaps a girl ( christina ricci ) from a tap dancing class to act as his wife . the film is very cheaply made , and it shows it throughout a lot of the movie , but you don ' t need money to make a good film . buffalo ? 66 doesn ' t always stay with the realistic concept , and sometimes goes through outrageous events . gallo ' s parents , played by angelica huston and ben gazarra , are two very strange individuals . the mother plays a football fanatic and the father plays a quiet man with odd habits . gallo and ricci arrive at his parent ' s house , and some extremely funny scenes take place within the house . ricci ' s performance during the scene at gallo ' s parent ' s home are very well done . there is constantly humor involved in the interesting dinner table scenes . the way the movie was filmed in this particular part of the movie were interesting and creative . they seemed very mediocre , but they worked out just fine . gallo ' s character is developed very well . the impression that he is very depressed and confused is very clear . gallo gives a performance that makes you believe what the character is going through . his character goes through many , many problems , just like many people in real life . this character seemed very realistic to me . ricci ' s character is funny and different . she doesn ' t care much that she has been kidnaped , in fact , she falls in love the man who kidnaped her ! ricci is a very wonderful actress and she is starting to get the recognition that she deserves . buffalo ? 66 isn ' t all laughs though . many scenes are very dramatic and depressing . gallo ' s character was so realistic , he was extremely disturbing . some scenes are supposed to come off as funny , but they actually seemed sad and real to life . the film sometimes drags along , not giving much material . i really would have liked to see gallo ' s parents a lot more , and i would have liked to see the characters developed more . overall , buffalo ? 66 isn ' t as good as some people put it up to be . the bottom line - a few hysterical scenes save this film from sinking to the bottom .\",\n",

       " (\"it was once said that in order to truly enjoy some of today \\x12 s movies or novels , you must \\x13 suspend disbelief . \\x14 however , there is a distinct separation between opening your mind to ridiculous situations and believing a bunch of flat lies . it came as no surprise to me to learn that huntingburg , indiana ( where the film is set ) , does not have a mcdonald ' s , a sears store , a statue of a man on a horse , nor even a dam close by . even if you can ignore these somewhat \\x13 white \\x14 lies ( even though the dam is crucial to hard rain \\x12 s plot ) ; there is still a bunch of things that just don \\x12 t gel . firstly , morgan freeman , possibly the greatest actor alive ( after such films as driving miss daisy , the shawshank redemption and se7en ) , was cast as a shifty goon intent on stealing enough money for a healthy retirement . he _should_ have played the town sheriff , an experienced and somewhat intriguing policeman . as a massive flood started by a dam accident overwhelms huntingburg , its residents presumably flee as the water level steadily increases . i say presumably simply because we never know what happened to them ; and it seems a tad strange that an entire town ( with the exception of some folk who get introduced along the way ) can vanish before the flood has actually started . but nether the less , armored guard couriers tom ( christian slater ) and his uncle are carrying three million dollars in the back of their van . with a heavy rainstorm causing depressing conditions and slippery roads , it doesn \\x12 t take long for the van to end up stuck amongst mud and water off the side of the road . jim ( morgan freeman ) and a small gang of thieves locate the van and attempt to steal the three million dollars . but of course tom is more than willing to save the day , so he takes the money and hides it elsewhere in town . the local sheriff ( randy quaid , whom most will remember as the drunken pilot in id4 ) and a couple of police men investigate the situation , but their morals are soon overpowered by greediness as each character contemplates what he / she would do with their share of the three million dollars . director mikael salomon has made sure that hard rain ends up turning everything topsy - turvy , and whilst the film may at first appear to be a definite \\x13 goodies versus baddies , \\x14 there are numerous twists in it \\x12 s plot that make this a slightly more enjoyable experience . but by the time these interesting changes occur , it \\x12 s far too late in the film for them to have much affect . hard rain \\x12 s continuos corniness and lack of originality washes out whatever hope the script may have had ; and although it \\x12 s cast is somewhat appealing most of its stars act well below par . not at one stage capturing what could have been a fabulous on screen battle between slater and freeman , we are left to reminisce on films that dared to do something different and achieved more than what was expected . such titles as broken arrow ( slater and john travolta ) and face / off ( nicholas cage and john travolta ) come to mind as films that have mastered silver screen confrontations . strangely enough , they were both directed by john woo and both star john travolta . we can forgive morgan freeman for giving a slightly disappointing performance since he is newish to the action genre , but christian slater could have achieved so much more had the amount of crummy one liners been reduced and some personality added to his character . if you had asked me whether slater could perform well enough to substantially boost a movie prior to the release of broken arrow , my answer would have been a definite no . i now know that he has no excuse , and _can_ do better ( if you don \\x12 t believe me rent a copy of broken arrow from your local video store ) . although hard rain never really works from the start , i somehow felt feelings of missed opportunity when the credits filled the screen . the addition of an enticing sub - plot would have given the film time to breathe , rather than try to cram 96 minutes of action and disaster into a story that can \\x12 t handle anything else . despite the fact that hard rain fails on almost every account , if your standards are low enough you may find this to be a mildly enjoyable film . no creative flair and no inventive scenes means that hard rain does not stand up well against its many competitors , but it doesn \\x12 t really matter since the last thing you would want to do after shelling about $ 8 . 50 is compare this to other films .\",\n",

       " ('in wonder boys michael douglas plays an aged writer \\\\ professor with such lived - in naturalism that i believe it may be his best performance . ever since wall street , douglas has spent the greater part of his career playing variations on the shark in a suit gordon gecko character he personified in the mid - 80 \\' s . in those performances he tended to exaggerate the vehemence of cutthroat businessmen , with much frothing at the mouth while projecting all his bad intentions to the world . you \\' d think such a man would keep his evil wrapped tightly underneath a good - natured veneer , but from gordon gecko to nicholas van orton , douglas played the role straight and out in the open . in wonder boys his performance isn \\' t showy or a tour de force , it \\' s simple yet truthful . he embodies grady , a craggy old writer with a predilection for pot and pink bathrobes . grady instructs a writers workshop while working tirelessly on a follow up to the novel that put him on the map . when we first encounter this curmudgeon in the midst of his workshop , we hear his sardonic narration on the soundtrack as students bombard one of their own with unfair criticisms . grady points out , in his narration , that they only do so out of jealousy . their target is the very writerly named james leer ( played by the always understated tobey maguire ) , a student full of potential and one whom grady develops a mild affection for . leer is the kind of youth who seems to mechanically block out emotions . he speaks in an intellectualized monotone with just a hint of dry wit around the edges . he \\' s portentous and gloomy , as if modeling himself after the great depressed writers , though his act is a little too calculated . he reminds me of the self - imposed outcast film director , jim jarmusch ( dead man , ghost dog ) . whenever i happen to catch jarmusch in an interview i see the man speaking in a toneless manner ( the monotonous drawl supposedly masking depth or contempt for his interviewer ) , exclusively dressed in black , and with his spiked hair dyed snow white . leer is similar , a guy who equates quirks with depth . tobey maguire fits well in the role . with his round , sweet - eerie face he resembles bud cort from harold and maude . but unlike cort , maguire is easier to warm up to ; he \\' s a messed up kid reaching for artistic credibility . katie holmes plays hannah , a beautiful , talented writing student just itching to get in grady \\' s pants . this is a plot line i had trouble with . douglas , in his old age , is beginning to resemble jerry springer , a man who has actually paid for sex on numerous documented occasions . at first i found it extremely difficult to believe that someone as beautiful as hannah would desire grady ( maybe it \\' s because i \\' m jealous , and wish holmes was throwing herself at me , after all i may just be a lowly internet critic but at least i still have all my teeth ) , then i think of douglas \\' s real life companion , the breathtaking catherine zeta jones . seeing those two together looks a lot like a kidnapping . suddenly my mind has shifted from the task at hand ( that being reviewing this completely wonderful movie ) and i \\' m pontificating on why the hell jones would desire douglas . there is a movie in there somewhere . grady , rather chivalrously if you ask me , resists the charms of hannah for sara gaskell ( a droll frances mcdormand ) , who is his age , but also married to another professor . okay , maybe not so chivalrous . there is a great line in the film spoken by douglas about sara where he says , \" she was a junkie for the printed word . lucky for me i manufactured her drug of choice \" . robert downy j . r plays a bisexual editor who makes his entrance with a towering transvestite on his arm . downy has mastered the gleefully dry hyper articulate wit of many a hipster intellectual . he \\' s arrogant but completely likeable in his utter arrogance . the actor is perfectly cast here , and remains a joyous movie presence somewhere between a typical tom hanksian comic leading man and edgy character actor . i wish wonder boys had more of him . searching for a plot among the elements of wonder boys would be pointless , for it meanders through its running time , but that \\' s part of its charm . and maybe i \\' m a bit biased towards the film because it takes place in a haven of literary academia , a place i \\' m greatly fond of , and a place rarely explored in american cinema . everyone has a sub - genre ( be it war films , westerns , dance movies ) that they happen to be privy to . i \\' m privy to films about literary types i . e . those individuals enthralled by the written word , and if you are not so inclined it may be wise to knock my above grade down about half a notch . the direction by curtis hanson is more akin to a european film with its leisurely pace and situations that grow from the characters , rather than generic mapped out story points . sometimes the dialogue is too clever , but that \\' s a problem i wish i found with films more often . another minor quibble is that early on the film seems a bit too introverted , like its characters , but as the story progresses it begins to open up . for me wonder boys works as subtle drama because of its insight into artistic types , and as a low - key comedy for its chuckle - worthy throwaway gags . the gags are like those in the great robert altman ( m * a * s * h , the long goodbye ) movies , where jokes exist as asides on the fringes , like jokes in life often do . the broader comedy such as the killing of a blind dog , and incessant smoking of marijuana isn \\' t ineffective but not nearly as memorable as the little things . curtis hanson , who before his last film , la confidential , toiled about with exploitation fare like losin \\' it ( an early tom cruise sex comedy ) and the hand the rocks the cradle , has graduated to more meaningful films . he directs wonder boys in an appropriately dour style , the comedy coming from the false gloom his characters put up . the morose crooning of leonard cohen would seem an odd song for the background of any party , but in a wonder boys party , it fits . the film is like a piece of literature put up on the big screen . it \\' s the cinematic equivalent to a good read , novelistic in its approach with themes rarely found in american movies . many will find it slight , but i found much to savor among its subtleties .',\n",

       " ('\" no man is an island , \" one character quotes john donne in apt pupil , effectively summarizing the movie \\' s themes . while hardly a great film , singer \\' s ambitious adaptation of king \\' s short story * is challenging nonetheless ; perhaps the most shocking aspect of this inclement psychological thriller is that a major studio got behind it . apt pupil is a bleak picture destined to be misunderstood by the masses . 1984 . wonder - bred high school honours student todd bowden ( renfro ) conducts his own extracurricular investigation of kurt dussander , a nazi war criminal who fearfully fled berlin in the 1960s and was never heard from again . bowden suspects arthur denker ( mckellan ) , the lonely german senior citizen who lives nearby , is actually a pseudonymous dussander - much research and dusting for fingerprints proves young todd \\' s theory . bowden strikes a deal with dussander : in exchange for not revealing his identity , dussander must satisfy bowden \\' s intense curiosity by recounting the atrocities of the holocaust from the nazi point of view . the stories he hears keep todd up at night and haunt his daydreams , but like a bystander at a traffic accident , todd \\' s desire for gory details overrides his repulsion . bowden revives in dussander feelings dormant since the end of wwii . marching in a mock uniform around his kitchen is wholly cathartic for dussander : it leads to his torture of a cat and the torment of his \" student \" , among other things . bowden , who has taken on very hateful qualities ( he kills birds and doodles swastikas on his notebook ) , engages the veteran in an endless game of one - upmanship . dussander stands to lose his freedom , and bowden his credibility - in effect , his post - secondary school future . all of this winds down to a fairly unpredictable ( and unsettling ) conclusion , one which requires leaps of faith from its audience yet is more satisfying than the source material \\' s excessive climax . singer has yet to get keyser s ? ze out of his system . his the usual suspects and apt pupil are both about evil masquerading as innocence ( verbal \\' s tics and todd \\' s golden - boy reputation are plausible ruses ) ; they showcase morally bankrupt anti - heroes to whom telling the truth is not an option if they are to achieve their goals . apt pupil is a richer film than the usual suspects , a movie famous and popular partly because its plot machinations were not germane to the outcome - there was no way you could see the ending coming , as it was all a hoodwink , anyway . thankfully , singer has gotten most of the usual suspects \\' film - schoolish geek theatrics out of his system . some scenes in apt pupil feel overdirected and / or obvious ( the dream sequences were extraneous ) , but the majority of the film is subdued - and singer \\' s handling of the violent scenes is boldly restrained for a film about a murderer and a murderer - in - training . mckellan \\' s and renfro \\' s performances contribute enormously to the overall success of the film ; while most people will focus on british stage vet mckellan \\' s finely - tuned realization , i \\' d like to single out renfro \\' s daring work . he isn \\' t afraid to play someone largely unappealing and cold - hearted ; he strips his character of vanity , something many of his peers wouldn \\' t do . ( can you picture kieran culkin or jonathan taylor - thomas in the same role ? ) renfro was recently charged with possession of cocaine - i hope he doesn \\' t continue down that path , because he has a big future in good movies waiting for him . as guidance counsellor edward french , \" friend \" schwimmer also deserves mention . he wants to be the parent to todd that todd \\' s own well - to - do folks are not ( todd , like most modern kids - and only - children - has mom and dad wrapped around his pinky finger ) , and his sincerity makes the apt pupil \\' s blackening - heart even more apparent . but one of the film \\' s ultimate questions , are we born evil or do we learn evil ? , might be answered in french , whose motives are the slightest bit ambiguous . no man is an island , indeed - we all have the capacity to make the \" right \" or the \" wrong \" choices . schwimmer winningly plays one of a trio of fascinating characters who make the unconventional apt pupil laudible . - october , 1998 * the excellent collection king \\' s stories called different seasons spawned not only apt pupil , but the shawshank redemption ( originally titled rita hayworth and the shawshank redemption ) and stand by me ( originally titled the body ) .',\n",

       " (\"jack nicholson has a funny way of playing characters with very few redeeming qualities , but whom you end up liking anyway . in as good as it gets , the character in question is melvin udall , a successful novelist with obsessive - compulsive disorder who seems bent on having as little contact with people around him as possible , except when he feels like being a royal pain in the you - know - where . he ' s mean . i mean really mean . the opening scene shows him shoving a little dog down the trash chute of his manhattan condominium . every day , melvin eats at the same cafe , sits at the same table , and gets served by the same waitress . you can tell that this is his favorite place to be a vicious nuisance , when his waitress carol ( helen hunt ) tells him he can just go sit in another section , and all the other waitresses just cringe . one day , melvin makes a comment that goes to far , and carol , genuinely hurt , comes down on him like a ton of bricks . at that point we find that she is not only the only person who can put up with him as a matter of course , but is also the only person who can get to him , too . another person who often crosses melvin ' s sights is simon ( greg kinnear ) , an artist who lives on melvin ' s floor . aside from the fact that he lives near the terror of the city , simon has the added benefit of being gay , making him a prime target . simon ' s friend frank ( cuba gooding , jr . ) , also gay , does not fare much better . when simon walks in on a pair of men robbing his apartment , he is brutally beaten and sent to the hospital , and frank , who has grown tired of seeing his friend take the verbal abuse dished out by his neighbor , intimidates melvin into watching after simon ' s dog while he convalesces . this is the same dog melvin had earlier shoved down the garbage . an interesting thing happens when melvin takes this dog in : melvin gets to like the dog , and the two develop an attachment which is the catalyst to melvin ' s softening up to the world around him . it doesn ' t happen overnight , but throughout the film , he bites his tongue here , cares a little there , and most miraculously , falls in love . one of the best elements of this film is watching melvin try to express feelings which are not the usual negative ones he so often shares with others . he ' s traveling terra incognita here , and it shows . good performances are turned in by all principal players in this film , especially by nicholson and hunt . they play well off of each other and have a genuine chemistry which makes it a pleasure to watch them on screen . greg kinnear , who is becoming known for his supporting film roles , is also very good at playing the vulnerable simon . he gives a short monologue about what it means for him to be an artist , and delivers it with such inspiration and conviction that you actually get to feel some of what he feels . cuba gooding jr . performs with a hyped - up level of energy which contrasts nicely with that of kinnear , and comes through with a near constant comic performance . the screenplay , by mark andrus and james l . brooks , is clever , touching , and funny . the best part about it , however , is that it is filled with characters we care about because they are actually interesting . melvin is a man we can ' t quite figure out , but whose mannerisms and quirky qualities capture our attention . carol is a working woman living with her mother , trying to take care of a child with a debilitating respiratory problem . simon is a man who is a success in his circle of peers , but who is still not accepted by much of society . combined with the talent of the actors , these characters make the film . the one noticeable area where the film is lacking , however , is the absence of cuba gooding , jr . through the second half . his character makes an exit which is supposed to be temporary , but the film ends before his return , leaving his relationship with simon and melvin unresolved . i would have liked to have seen more of his character in general , in addition to a part in the film ' s conclusion . there ' s one actor , who will probably not be recognized by any awards , but who contributes greatly to many of the movie ' s best scenes and who deserves mention . this is that little dog . he plays such a pivotal role to melvin ' s character development , actually serves to forward the plot , and has some absolutely scene - stealing moments , that it is hard to believe he is simply an animal . award or no , however , when even the dog puts in a good performance , you know you ' ve got an outstanding movie .\",\n",

       " ('118 minutes ; not rated ( though i suspect it would be rated pg for adult themes and language ) mamoru oshii is a name that probably isn \\' t very well - known to most american audiences , but perhaps it should be . oshii was the director of last year \\' s best - known japanese animated film import , _ghost in the shell_ , and is known among fans of japanese animation , or anime , for making films with a deep philosophical bent . one of these films was the first theatrical venture for the patlabor animated series . in its many incarnations -- graphic novels ( \" manga \" ) , two different runs of made - for - video episodes ( original animation videos , or oavs for short ) , and a television series running to nearly fifty episodes -- patlabor has proven to be one of the most popular series ever in japan . set in the very near future ( though it was a somewhat farther away near future when the series was first conceived ) , this atypical giant robot anime features the characters , rather than the machinery , as the primary focus . as a whole , patlabor is the story of an exciting time for japan . as the prologue to each episode of the television series explains , giant industrial robots , known as \" labors \" ( an interesting play on words , considering that \" robot \" is derived from the czech word for labor ) , have come into widespread use in japan toward the close of the twentieth century . with the rise of labors , however , has come a new menace -- labor crime . this led to the creation of the two special vehicle divisions , using patrol labors to fight labor crime . the patlabor story centers around the second special vehicle division , sv2 , who , through no fault of their own , have acquired a bad reputation for destructiveness . sometimes utterly hilarious , sometimes almost deadly serious , the patlabor series explores the interpersonal relationships of the special vehicle crewmembers , and also looks at the effects of technology on modern life . those who are unfamiliar with the patlabor story and characters may find themselves slightly confused coming into the movie , although there is ample background exposition provided for new viewers . the story , as has much of patlabor before , centers around the controversial babylon project , a gigantic seawall that will , on its completion , allow the reclamation of thousands of square miles of land from tokyo bay . this project has been an almost constant target of environmentalist terrorists , most notably the house of sea organization . however , the threat in this case comes not from any terrorist , but from someone who is already dead . . . shinohara heavy industries , the premier labor manufacturer in japan ( if not the whole world ) , has just come out with a new operating system that increases labors \\' movement speed and efficiency by 30 % . this hyper operating system , hos for short , has very quickly been installed into well over 90 % of the nation \\' s labors . . . including the patrol labors of sv2 . since that installation , dozens of labors , including a heavily - armed military model , have begun to go on berzerk rampages for no apparent reason . . . and the only factor they all had in common was that they were all running under the new hos . ( some wags have compared this to windows 95 . ) it \\' s up to asuma shinohara , labor command officer with sv2 and the son of the president of shinohara heavy industries , to find the source of these problems before more labors -- including sv2 \\' s own -- fall victim to them , and before hos drags his father \\' s company down with it . as was the case with _ghost in the shell_ , if you just want a no - brainer actionfest , this might not be the movie for you . _patlabor : the movie_ is more of a psychological thriller , a technological suspense drama . it is closer , perhaps , to a chrichton novel than to an action movie ( crichton novels that have been made _into_ action movies notwithstanding ) . there are long , thoughtful montages of dialogueless footage as two investigators make their way through slums and derelict housing in old quarters of tokyo , similar to sequences from _ghost in the shell_ . this movie is fraught with symbolism -- in fact a large part of it is based on christian symbolism . patlabor \\' s near - future setting is , aside from the giant robots tromping around , very similar to our own present day . the film uses this setting to make its central point : is progress moving too fast for humans to keep up ? are history and culture falling by the wayside like the old buildings that are being torn down and replaced with new ? this is a question just as applicable to today as it is to patlabor \\' s alternate - 1999 setting . as far as the technical aspects of the film go ( referring to the subtitled version , as that \\' s the only one i \\' ve seen ) , the film transfer is clear , almost phenomenally so . the animation quality is incredible , though the character design is different from what most patlabor fans will be used to . the oavs and tv series were more cheerful , better - suited to humor ; the movie , however , makes everyone look a great deal less cute , and emphasizes that this is going to be , for the most part , a deadly serious storyline . as far as cinematography goes , there are many interesting moments in _patlabor : the movie_ . i don \\' t think i can recall ever seeing a fish - eye perspective used in any other animated film ( save for _ghost in the shell_ , another oshii film ) , or indeed , in many other movies at all . the cinematography is well - suited to the storyline , emphasizing what it needs to , though a couple of scenes ( where characters \\' features are exaggerated in anger ) may seem slightly strange to western audiences . the audio track of _patlabor : the movie_ is in glorious hi - fi stereo , and should be used to demonstrate home theater systems -- it _is_ that good . even without headphones , sounds from either side of the screen can be clearly heard to _come_ from that side . giant robot footsteps are deep and booming . the sometimes - understated , sometimes - blaring score is crisp and clear , and always right on the mark , enhancing the moods created by the animated scenery . as far as the subtitles go , i have to say that they \\' re among the most easily - readable subtitles i \\' ve ever seen for _anything_ . large enough that they don \\' t strain the eyes , but small enough not to conceal too much of the screen . although it does have several action sequences in it , most notably the climactic conclusion , _patlabor_ is foremost not an action movie . although it is a superbly - realized film , it relies in large part upon prior familiarity with some of the characters to carry the story , and that could detract from some people \\' s enjoyment . my .',\n",

       " ('\" sometimes the \\' green mile \\' seems sooooo long . \" indeed . and any filmmaker with a three hour movie who ends it with that gem of dialogue should expect to see it quoted in a review . on a more positive note , let me add that sometimes the green mile is almost good enough to make us forget its length . the mile in question ( green due to its faded lime - colored linoleum ) leads from the prison cell to \" old sparky , \" the electric chair where executions were carried out at louisiana \\' s cold mountain penitentiary in 1935 . paul edgecomb ( tom hanks , you \\' ve got mail ) is the head guard of e - block , otherwise known as death row . keeping his prisoners calm as they await the carrying out of their sentence is his primary responsibility . it is a responsibility which he capably delegates to the other guards on his watch by insisting they \" talk to \" the convicts instead of yelling at them . this practice leads to an unusual camaraderie between the guards and the men behind their bars . into his charge comes one john coffey ( michael clarke duncan , armageddon ) , a seven foot tall gentle giant who has been convicted of the rape and murder of two young girls . immediately , paul senses something different about this prisoner . perhaps its the way he asked for a night light because he is frightened of the dark . or perhaps it is the mystical healing powers he demonstrates as he \" takes back \" paul \\' s bladder infection thereby restoring him to health . based on steven king \\' s 1996 serialized novel , the green mile does offer other characters who have stories to be told : eduard delacroix ( michael jeter , patch adams ) , is a frail cajun convict who befriends and trains a mouse to do circus tricks ; percy wetmore ( doug hutchison , a time to kill ) , is a young and sadistic guard sitting on a transfer to a more lucrative position because he has yet to see a prisoner \" fry \" up close ; and hal moores ( james cromwell , babe : pig in the city ) is the compassionate warden for whom , despite all the executions he \\' s witnessed , death never loomed as large as when his own wife was diagnosed with a tumor . while it is mr . hanks \" everyman \" performance at the center of the film which gives it the anchor to hold our interest for 180 minutes , it is the performances of his supporting cast that are most worth noting . all involved do credible work in their respective roles , most especially mr . duncan , who turns in an impressive , fully realized characterization . if only the story were more credible . writer / director frank darabont ( the shawshank redemption ) has crafted a flawed fantasy / allegory of sorts ; one which is more spiritualistic than spiritual , relying on a preternatural mysticism rather than a genuine and godly spiritual power . mr . darabont also overplays his hand considerably in the manipulation of our affection towards and association with his characters . was it an accidental omission that the first two inmates who walked the green mile were being punished for crimes never disclosed ? by not knowing the reason for the condemned convicts \\' presence on e - block , the audience never gets the sense of the justice which is being carried out , making the death penalty appear cruel and unwarranted . this is especially true during the gruesome depiction of the second execution which was horribly botched . much has also been made of coffey \\' s christ - like ability to heal but unlike the numerous healings which are recorded in the scriptures , coffey \\' s powers are shrouded in mystery , taking on the feel of a circus trick , coupled with a voodoo - like \" i feel your pain \" transference . in contrast , there is no mystery associated with the healing that is from god . the genuine \" gifts of healing \" listed in 1 corinthians 12 is just one of the nine manifestations of holy spirit and can be operated by any spiritually instructed man or woman in accordance with the knowledge and wisdom of god . true spiritual healing ( with few exceptions ) requires the committed believing of both the healer as well as the one being healed . such believing comes not from the shrouded secrets of mysticism , but from the revealed word of god .',\n",

it is possible to like a film that focuses on grime and sick behaviour ( ie . \" se7en \" ) , but it takes a large measure of restraint ( schumacher has none ) and a larger amount of talent ( schumacher has little ) . by those jabs , i \\' m not only referring to his stylish destruction of the \" batman \" franchise , but \" a time to kill \" was an immensely overrated disappointment . for a guy who gets so much studio money , his track record of making rather bad movies is unparalleled . a good screenwriter and a good director can make you hypnotically watch even disgusting subject matter . writer andrew kevin walker didn \\' t recapture the smarts of the fascinating script he authored for \\' 95s twisted thriller , \" se7en \" . director schumacher doesn \\' t have that innate ability to make you watch things you don \\' t really want to see like better directors are capable of doing . he must not have believed hitchcock who espoused the theory that what we don \\' t see is more frightening than what we do ( especially when it \\' s a scene where young girl is supposed to be murdered ) . however , gratuitous is joel \\' s middle name . he must think that not flaunting a hard - core act of violent sex is showing plenty of tactful restraint . no , he doesn \\' t go that far , but we see enough unpleasantness . he doesn \\' t leave much to the imagination . it \\' s manipulating to hurt ( or kill ) young girls just to get the audience on the side of a murderous vigilante . the script and acting should be what gets us to believe in these characters , yet schumacher has no subtlety in his ( ha ha ! ) craft . case in point , a shot of a christian fellowship bus ( good , right ? ) drives away to reveal one of the villains ( bad , right ? ) . see . . . no subtlety . does joel think we \\' re stupid or that we need to be held by the hand to comprehend the contrasting imagery ? who do we root for in this mess ? is there anybody out there ? it \\' s not all the director \\' s fault , though . why did the actors sign up for this ? nicolas cage is an oscar - winner , for cryin \\' out loud ! if he claims to do films to challenge himself and for the artistic merit rather than the money , what was he smoking when this script dropped on his veranda ? what is cage supposed to be in this movie -- a whispering batman without the charisma and pointed ears ? villainous peter stormare is five steps past hammy . and what is james gandolfini doing in this trash ? he was so solid as a concerned father in \" a civil action \" . i guess ol \\' nic , pete , and jim were promised a mountain of money . . . or they \\' re suckers . or they just don \\' t care . there are moments ( albeit brief ones ) where this rises above the wasteland . catherine keener is good ( although too quick to threaten divorce ) as mrs . wells . baby cindy is obviously cute and wells \\' devout love of his daughter is sweet . the mother ( amy norton ) of the girl in the infamous 8mm film is not too bad as a woman dealing with the uncertain loss of her runaway daughter . this film has an appropriate blue - toned , washed - out look like \" payback \" ( which was a much better movie ) . the editing is okay in scenes of no dialogue , but at other times it \\' s rough . during some conversations , close - ups and wide shots are not cut very well , making it look to be editted by someone whose instincts aren \\' t good and whose timing was a half - second off . such a technical error indeed stands out . speaking of standing out , don \\' t believe the misleading trailers . there \\' s not much action here . occasionally , yes , but not as often as your tv will have you believe . after seeing \" 8mm \" , i may not be interested in ever watching any kind of porn again . is that a positive ? well , if making me almost ill at the thought of glimpsing a dirty movie again is their motive , they \\' ve done a swell job here . it \\' ll be a long time before i give a schumacher film another chance -- unless i lose my mind and become seriously depraved . but today i \\' m not depraved , so i ask , why does this film preach that this garbage is out there and that society should be worried about it ? i \\' m sure that somewhere right now there \\' s some pretty sick crap going on , but that doesn \\' t mean i need to know about it . yes , mr . walker , your script tells us that there are some screwed - up folks out there . yes , mr . walker , the proverbial monster doesn \\' t look like we expect him to . you said all that in 1995 . move on . this film serves no purpose . it doesn \\' t entertain , it doesn \\' t teach us anything , it doesn \\' t make a statement beyond the obvious \" this stuff is bad \" approach . only if this film awakens the authorities to find a way to abolish these types of horrors would it ever do someting truly worthwhile . that \\' s not likely to happen , though , so \" 8mm \" is indeed a scummy waste of money . orson welles said years ago in a tribute to film , \" to movies . . . to good movies \" . if only joel schumacher and the producers had listened and told andrew kevin walker to bury this crud deep in a hole . like \" snuff \" films , \" 8mm \" should never have been made . now , excuse me while i go try to forget i ever saw it . useless trivia -- joel schumacher loves the vigilante theme . he used it in \" batman forever \" , in \" batman & robin \" , in \" a time to kill \" , in \" falling down \" , and it \\' s rumoured that joel himself will play the vigilante at his breakfast table tomorrow . . .',\n",

       " ('\" the faculty , \" the heavily - hyped and advertised sci - fi / horror film that has teamed up director robert rodriguez ( 1995 \\' s \" desperado \" and 1996 \\' s \" from dusk till dawn \" ) and screenwriter kevin williamson ( 1996 \\' s \" scream \" and 1997 \\' s \" scream 2 \" ) , is being called a cross between \" invasion of the body snatchers \" and \" the breakfast club , \" and i don \\' t think i could describe it any better than that . the film sets up the six central teenage characters who do not seem to have much in common , and then the science - fiction aspect is added , involving the fear that the faculty at herrington high school are actually aliens who are quickly transforming everyone in the town . the six characters , as in \" the breakfast club , \" can be easily labeled as a stereotype , but as they are developed , they become far more complex : casey ( elijah wood ) , the much picked upon nerd ; stokely ( clea duvall ) , a goth outcast who hides behind the false facade of being a lesbian so everyone will avoid her ; zeke ( josh hartnett ) , a drug dealer who turns out to be a science whiz ; stan ( shawn hatosy ) , the star football quarterback who is considering quitting the team to concentrate more on academics ; delilah ( jordanna brewster ) , the popular cheerleader and newspaper journalist ; and marybeth ( laura harris ) , the sweet \\' n southern new girl in town . although the characters are only slightly connected ( i . e . casey is delilah \\' s photojournalist assistant ; marybeth tries to become buddies with stokely , since they both don \\' t have friends , etc . ) , when they all begin to suspect the teachers due to some grotesque and strange occurrences , the only people they can count on for help is each other , even though they aren \\' t really even sure if they can trust one another . \" the faculty \" is another smart and pop - culturally hip film from williamson , although it does not equal up to his best film , the original \" scream , \" and rodriguez , whose \" from dusk till dawn \" is still one of the more original genre films of the 90 \\' s . williamson and rodriguez are so assured at their professions , respectively , that the idea of teaming up together is pretty much a no - brainer . the plotline of \" the faculty , \" involving aliens taking over other people \\' s bodies , has been done quite a lot before , from \" invasion of the body snatchers , \" to \" the puppet masters , \" to \" invaders from mars , \" so one of the obstacles that williamson and rodriguez had to overcome was to somehow make the idea seem fresh , and by setting the goings - on at a high school and having the protagonists be a group of teens , they were mostly successful . surely , the conventions of the story are still the same , and the climax was inevitable , but there were a few surprises along the way , including the question of who were the aliens , and who weren \\' t . the epilogue was also a refreshing change - of - pace as it did not set up a sequel but ended on a note that probably could not have been any better . the performances in \" the faculty \" were a treat throughout , since there were so many recognizable actors in roles that were the polar opposite of what they usually do . one exception were the teens , who , aside from elijah wood , are not very well - known , but they all aquit themselves nicely , particularly wood ( the seasoned pro ) , clea duvall , and jordanna brewster . as members of the faculty , robert patrick ( \" t2 : judgement day \" ) was creepy as the gym coach ; piper laurie was amusing and threatening as the drama teacher ; bebe neuwirth actually was somehow able to look like an alien ; and salma hayek , as the school nurse with a bad case of the cold , was very funny in a small role . the standout , in my opinion , of the whole cast was famke janssen who turns in an oddly touching performance as the shy and meek english teacher who , after turning into an alien , becomes the sex bombshell . if there was any problem i had with the faculty , it was that some of them were given no real payoff in the climactic sequence . since the teenagers realize that in order to save everyone they must kill the \" queen \" alien , many of the faculty members disappear . it might have been more fun if they had to face every one of the teachers , although the finale is still pretty impressive , and includes some showstopping creature effects , especially for a relatively low 15 - million - dollar budget . although not one of the best horror or science - fiction films i have seen , \" the faculty \" is still an exciting and worthy film that dimension films was smart to release around the holiday season when this type of genre offering is usually not released . while the story is as old as the hills , it is also , in a way , timeless , because everyone , i think , has suspected at one time or another that a certain person simply did not act right , as if they really weren \\' t human . and by putting this idea in the setting of a small - town high school , it perfectly contrasts with the alienation that most teenagers usually go through when relating to adults and other peers . + note : the ad and poster campaign for this film is hugely misleading , as it features r & b artist usher raymond as one of the main characters . in actuality , he only has a small role as one of stan \\' s buddies who becomes quarterback after stan resigns from the team . if i were one of the heads from dimension , i would change this advertising at once , since it is unnecessary and rather deceiving .',\n",

( cinematographer remi adafarasin often allows space to engulf them ; i \\' m reminded the climax , which unfolds in a sea of white . ) martha fiennes has a clear command of cinema , and her spare , often painfully human visual presentation of \" yevgeny onegin \" is arguably the most lucid translation of pushkin \\' s difficult text yet . ms . fiennes may be the most exciting female presence behind a camera since jane campion .',\n",

       " ('a new entry in the \" revisionist history \" genre of filmmaking , dick suggests that two not - too - bright teenage girls are the cause of the uncovering of the nation \\' s biggest presidential scandal . kirsten dunst and michelle williams star betsy and arlene , who while trying to deliver a fan letter from arlene \\' s watergate hotel room , accidentally stumble across g . gordon liddy ( played dead - on by harry shearer ) and the infamous break - in . when they recognize liddy later on during a white house field trip , they are ushered into a conference room , questioned as to what they know , and leave as official presidential dog walkers . the girls manage to unwittingly uncover every bit of the watergate scandal while performing their duties , but have no clue as to what they are getting involved with . when they discover that nixon ( another dead - on performance by dan hedaya , who actually favors nixon slightly , unlike anthony hopkins ) has been abusive to checkers , the presidential dog , thanks to the conversations that he always recorded , they quit and become disillusioned . during a prank phone call the girls make to woodward and bernstein , events are set into motion that eventually lead to the president \\' s resignation . this film starts off promisingly with an aged woodward and bernstein arguing with each other on an obvious larry king - type talk show ( featuring a cameo by french stewart ) about revealing the identity of \" deep throat \" . from there , we are subjected to bodily function humor and just about every bad \" dick \" joke one can derive from this type of supposed comedy . at one point , the girls are having to scream over a high school band playing on the steps of the lincoln memorial . the band manages to stop right as dunst screams \" you have to stop letting dick run your life ! \" much to the horror of everyone standing within earshot . several other variations on this wordplay surface all throughout the film . if this movie had been smarter i would have been less likely to fault it \\' s juvenile bathroom humor , but it \\' s not . the film was apparently made for relatively younger people because every major player in the watergate scandal is introduced and shoved down the audience \\' s throat in the least subtle way possible . i don \\' t recall oliver stone \\' s nixon having to pander to it \\' s audience , but of course that film wasn \\' t a comedy aimed squarely at a 13 - 20 year - old film going audience . the only redeeming thing about this movie is it \\' s remarkable supporting cast . i wanted to see more of ferrell and mcculloch \\' s woodward and bernstein . those two characters are the sole basis for my rating . i wish they had been given more screen time , but unfortunately , they are only relegated to the final half - hour . their constant bickering and fighting over trying to get the story are a major highlight , especially mcculloch \\' s constant thwarting of ferrell \\' s attempts to gather information from the girls ( who , in the course of the narrative are revealed as deep throat , so named thanks to an ill planned trip to a porno theater by betsy \\' s brother ) . the other members of the cast are excellent in their portrayals of their particular characters , but are given nothing to work with . i \\' d like to see the same cast portray these characters in a script more suited towards their comedic abilities . as for the two leads , dunst and williams can definitely do better . they come off as what could best be described as romy and michele : the early years in this particular film , a highly dubious distinction at best . stay through the first half of the end credits though , to see an interesting scene involving dunst and williams suggestively sucking on lollipops emblazoned with the title of the movie . an excellent idea marred by poor execution , dick could have been a great movie . less of the juvenile humor and more of the smarter comedy displayed by the woodward and bernstein scenes , could have made this film a wonderful satire of the nixon presidency as seen through the eyes of two naive fifteen year olds . as it stands though , dick offers nothing but what filmmaker kevin smith so accurately defines as \" dick and poopie \" jokes . and that , to me , does not make a funny movie .

       " ('\" if there \\' s a beast in men , it meets its match in women , too . \" starring sarah patterson , angela lansbury , tusse silberg , david warner directed by neil jordan written by jordan and angela carter , from a story by carter cinematography by bryan loftus in recent years , there has been a trend in the field of fantasy : writers have been revisiting the fertile world of myth and fairy tale and reclaiming that world , investing it with new life and energy . in modern times , fairy tales have become disneyfied and debased ; they have become trite adventures involving leering witches , friendly dwarves , and cuddly talking animals . but in their original forms , fairy tales have a dark , wicked edge . crows tear out the eyes of cinderella \\' s sisters , a gorier fate then they receive in the animated version . hansel and gretel relish cooking the witch in her own oven . writers have become fascinated by the bloodier , morally ambivalent aspects of fairy tales , and are now modernizing the old stories while simultaneously going back to their roots . before this trend was in vogue , angela carter -- whose stories always have a dark , wicked , subversive edge -- had been reinventing fairy tales for years . in the company of wolves , she and neil jordan retell the story of red riding hood , enlivening it with werewolves , rolls royces , and a visit from satan . the story is structured as a dream , occurring in the mind of rosaleen ( sarah patterson ) , an adolescent girl about whose \\' real \\' life we learn very little . within the dream , there are a number of inset stories , most told by dream - rosaleen \\' s grandmother ( angela lansbury ) , and these tales gloss the central story in intriguing , suggestive ways . the result is a surprisingly successful example of a sinister , contemporary fairy tale . i say \" surprisingly \" because there are so many ways this film could have gone wrong . and there are ways in which it does . the performances are mediocre , except for lansbury \\' s -- she finds the right note for the prim , apple - cheeked granny , the wise and stern teller of cautionary tales . the soundtrack , synth - heavy , reminded me of bad 80s horror movies , as did the special effects in the shapechanging scenes . probably state - of - the - art at the time , they are now laughable . but jordan succeeds at what i consider the trickiest aspect of the film : he transcends the poor acting / music / effects and conveys a sense of the fantastic , of otherness . one of the problems in adapting full - blown fantasies is that fantasy is often best left to the imagination of the reader , rather than being subjected to the \\' realism \\' of the screen . part of me would love to see an adaptation of \\' the lord of the rings , \\' but , on the other hand , i know that any filmmaker \\' s recreation of ents , hobbits , and balrogs is inevitably going to be really lame compared to what i picture in my mind . this makes jordan \\' s accomplishment here seem mighty impressive to me : he imbues the company of wolves with a genuine sense of magic and mystery . the somewhat ruritanian dreamworld becomes a kind of ur - reality . the sunshine is exceptionally warm and abundant . the nights are quiet and misty and eerie and ghostly . the peasant village is rustic and cozy , the woods old and hoary . this archetypal realm is the setting for a smart , subtle , literate script , a script which is as good as you \\' d expect from jordan ( himself an accomplished fiction writer ) and carter . for carter , the cauldron of story is a witches \\' brew , bubbling over with primal ingredients : mist - shrouded forests , ancient graveyards , virginal girls and wise women , wolves with glowing eyes . she adeptly blends them all together . there is a symbolic richness to the film ; everything is permeated with a sense of significance . the point of it all , i think , is to represent a girl \\' s rites - of - passage on an unconscious , primordial level . a night - journey through the forest , from the village to the grandmother \\' s home , is the crux of the company of wolves . \" don \\' t stray from the path , \" rosaleen is told , again and again , and the path is both literal and figurative : the path through the forest and the path of life . staying on the path is the conventional approach suggested by rosaleen \\' s elders . carter and jordan , never conventional , explore what goes on when you leave the path . those who stray will supposedly meet with a dark fate . this fate is literalized in the dream as werewolves , but the werewolves connote many things : death , sex , knowledge . if straying from the path leads to death , then it \\' s not a good idea -- but if that \\' s what you have to risk to get sex and knowledge ( and therefore power ) , then maybe it \\' s worth the risk . when you leave the path , the world becomes a dangerous , ambiguous place , but it \\' s full of potential . and it \\' s certainly more interesting than the disney version .',\n",

( \" look into my eyes ! \" ) in fact , the last time that i \\' ve seen a guy so scared in a movie was john turturro in that forest scene from the coen brothers \\' miller \\' s crossing . scary shite . but there \\' s an ever better scene than that in this film . this one features bettany , once again , slowly torturing , hacking and beating the living piss out of a rival gangster ( from that man \\' s point - of - view ) , but not before turning on a quaint little tune in the background and removing all of his own expensive clothes , one by one ( that \\' s right , he \" does \" the guy in his underwear ) . that scene is also in tune with some of the obvious phallic and homoerotic undertones present throughout this film , especially in the relationship between bettany and his boss ( why does he get so upset when he falls in love with that woman ? ) . but the flick \\' s not perfect . in fact , i didn \\' t mind malcolm mcdowell \\' s voice - over narration at first , but as the film grew into a major flashback ( most of the film is presented as such ) , he came in every now and then , and rarely added anything of interest to the plot . all he seemed to do was swear and call people the c - word umpteen times , and even described one scene as it was happening ( \" . . . so i opened the door , then went up the lift , etc . . . . \" - it \\' s like , yeah , i know that already , i could see it on the screen ! ! overdone . ) . i also didn \\' t quite \" buy \" the ending of the movie , which despite being original , seemed a little unbelievable , especially when you consider that it \\' s supposed to be taking place 30 years later , and folks still seem to be holding grudges , still in love , still living in the same apartments ? ? ! ? i mean , c \\' mon . . . it \\' s 30 years , man ! ! i don \\' t know , somehow it didn \\' t work all that well for me . but one of my favorite genres has always been the crime movies , and this one is a decent addition to the lot . forget the lame title and malcolm mcdowell \\' s narration of the obvious plot points , and concentrate on the film \\' s stronger attributes such as its style , the exquisite atmosphere of the time period , its original look at the gangster dynamic within the same group , its memorable sequences and the solid performances from its two main leads , bettany and thewlis . incidentally , unlike a few of the gangster flicks that i mention below , this one is in no way a parody or homage to this genre of films . . . it \\' s the real deal ! note : this film is packed with strong accents all around , which makes it hard to make out some of the words from time to time . it \\' s also quite violent and i don \\' t remember any film that used the c - word as much as this one , so leave the kids at home for this one . . . ; ) where \\' s joblo coming from ? american psycho ( 10 / 10 ) - a clockwork orange ( 9 / 10 ) - donnie brasco ( 8 / 10 ) - fight club ( 10 / 10 ) - get carter ( 7 / 10 ) - godfather ( 10 / 10 ) - godfather ii ( 10 / 10 ) - goodfellas ( 10 / 10 ) - lock , stock & two smoking barrels ( 8 / 10 ) - pulp fiction ( 8 / 10 ) - reservoir dogs ( 9 / 10 )',\n",

       " (\"even if i did not know that director and co - writers james wong and jeffrey reddick of the creepy final destination helped create the hit television show the x - files , i would have inevitably made a connection . the similarities are very apparent from the inexplicable phenomenon - like plot , to the mysterious characters , to the overall dark , ominous settings . it would have been perfectly fitting to see fbi agents mulder and scully investigate this case , they witness stuff like this on a weekly basis ( in fact mulder and scully would have been a much more welcome change to the bland one dimensional fbi agents seen in this movie ) . another more important similarity , is that both succeed in entertaining and thrilling at the same time . this is a great accomplishment for a teen horror movie , especially when compared to some of the trash , of the same genre , released in the last couple of years ( urban legend and i still know what you did last summer are classic examples from the bunch ) . what helps final destination is its unique premise . unlike your average horror flick in which some invincible psycho with a knife chases blonde cheerleaders , the villain presented is unusual , it ' s the grim reaper . this being already has predestined when and how you will die . according to the brief history lesson given in this film , everyone was meant to die at a certain time , some people at 100 , others at 17 , whatever death chooses . what is unique about death is that it ' s already dead , so you can ' t really kill it . the only way to defeat death is to cheat it ; the question is how do you do that ? this dilemma is what faces alex and a group of teenagers . alex has been having some dreams that the airplane which will take his class on a trip to paris will crash , leaving no survivors . alex begins to realize that his dreams are a little too real and eventually gets himself and six others kicked off the plane right before it takes off . shortly after , the plane does indeed crash leaving some of the seven survivors confused and others feeling immortal . however , death isn ' t through with them yet . it gradually kills off the seven one by one , leaving those currently still alive frantically trying to trick death again . the plot allows for some of the most creative , original death scenes i have seen in a while . some scenes build up the perfect amount of tension until an elaborate climax , others are so unexpected they will leave your jaw wide open in shock . creativity and originality are two adjectives lacking in most horror films nowadays but final destination is not like most horror films . sure , it has your traditional share of jerks and outsiders ( ali larter ' s character is particularly annoying ) , but the shocks , from the beginning to the end , are extremely entertaining . also director wong has the sense not to take the movie too seriously . he knows its just another entertaining guilty pleasure that won ' t win any academy awards ( not even a golden globe ) . the myriad of inside jokes and gags ( the characters are named after famous horror directors , one character who plays a jerk is named carter , like x - files creator chris carter , and a song by john denver , who died in a plane crash , plays whenever death is near ) show this movie is a bunch of guys having a good time making a movie . and from this , i had a great time watching the movie .\",\n",

       " ('the sheer horrific audacity of the nazi plan to exterminate the jews of europe is almost incomprehensible . people may make documentaries about it for another hundred years and still not understand the organized , methodical hatred . five concentration camp survivors from the last days of world war ii tell their stories in the last days , the first documentary from steven spielberg \\' s survivors of the shoah visual history foundation . the five interviewees are linked by their hungarian ancestry . as the introduction explains , even as germany started to lose the war , the nazis stepped up their extermination of the jews in europe . in 1944 , hungary had the last big population of jews within germany \\' s reach , and they became the last target of hitler \\' s \" final solution . \" each of the five tells his or her story . their stories are intercut chronologically , starting from normal life in pre - war hungary . they recall the nazi invasion of hungary , being sent to \" work \" camps and their realization that they were actually in death camps . they recall their horrible , precarious lives in auschwitz and buchenwald ; the deaths of their family and friends ; their loss of hope . each recalls his or her unfathomable , eventual liberation . and finally , the last days shows their cathartic , pained , modern - day return to their old homes and the camps . needless to say , their stories are horrifying , amazing , and emotionally draining . by themselves , the stories would be forceful testaments , but by cutting them in parallel , their impact is multiplied by five . the last days is a talking - heads style documentary -- it \\' s mostly pictures of people telling their stories , intercut with period photographs and newsreel footage . in this kind of movie it \\' s almost impossible to get archival pictures from the same time and place being discussed on - screen , but director james moll made a better effort than most at finding specific , or at least relevant , images to go with his subjects \\' narration . the liner notes ( one of the many nice features of this dvd ) indicate that there is some never - before - seen historical footage in the last days . it \\' s not clear which scene it is . it could be one of two that i hadn \\' t seen before , both powerful . one is rare color footage , shot by an american , of piles of victims in cattle cars . there is something jarring , something unsettling about seeing the pictures in color , when so much of the footage from world war ii is in black and white . another segment shows walking skeletons ; survivors who are so starved that they hardly look human anymore . there has been a glut of holocaust movies and i was skeptical that a new documentary would have anything new to say . but by focusing on hungarian jews during the last days of the war , moll told a specific part of the story in a new way , in greater detail . and i \\' m glad he did because his careful filmmaking stands up well compared to other movies on the same subject . the transfer to dvd is rich and beautiful . x - mozilla - status : 0009f words for a holocaust documentary , but some of the interviews take place in europe in late spring , when skies are blue and trees are green . also , the movie was shot on 35mm film ( and not video ! ) , so the richness and detail are impeccable . the dvd \\' s features are plentiful and well - chosen . there is a theatrical trailer for the movie , which is a great introduction to the subject matter . there are about fifty still photos , both from the production crew and from the private collections of the survivors . also , the disc has two complete versions of the movie ( widescreen and full screen ) , both on the same side . one of the more interesting dvd features is an outtake segment for each of the survivors ( plus one for the crew ) . you \\' d think outtakes would be inappropriate in a holocaust documentary , but they \\' re not bloopers . instead , they are solid , moving segments that were probably cut from the film only for length . one of them continues a confrontation that was only touched on lightly in the film . renee firestone ( one of the five ) spoke on camera with dr . hans m ? nch , a german doctor who ran the medical clinic at auschwitz . firestone was aggressive , questioning the doctor about what his children thought . the doctor was evasive and clearly uncomfortable . another of the outtakes showed bill basch saying a prayer for his dead friends at auschwitz . he ends his prayer by saying \" . . . forgive me for surviving . \" it \\' s ambitious to shoot a documentary on 35mm film . it \\' s ambitious to make it on a subject that has saturated cable , television , and movies . it \\' s ambitious to make it 54 years after the events it covers . but the last days handles all these potential obstacles very well . it \\' s only fitting that the dvd , with its wealth of interesting and relevant features , would also be ambitious and successful .',\n",

       " ('* * the following review contains spoilers * * \" please someone stop joel schumacher before he vomits into a film canister again and tries to pass it off as a movie . \" -- chuck dowling , the jacksonville film journal i wrote the above sentence in my review for 1997 \\' s batman and robin . apparently , no one heard my words . oh , how i wish you had heard them . oh how i wish someone had stopped him . . . because he \\' s done it again . the plot of 8mm is similar to the 1977 paul schrader film hardcore , a surprisingly decent and engrossing tale . in fact , it was everything that 8mm is not . in the opening minutes of 8mm , we see private detective tom welles ( nicolas cage ) working on a case for a prestigious member of the u . s . government . keep this fact in mind , cage is trusted with an important case , which he solves . he returns home to his wife and new daughter , and even finds time to rake his yard ( keep that in mind too , it \\' s important as well ) . he \\' s hired by a rich elderly woman to solve a mystery . after her husband \\' s death she comes across a film in his private safe . it appears to be snuff film , a sort of urban legend of the pornography industry in which someone is actually brutally murdered for the camera . the woman wants welles to locate the young girl in the film , hopefully to disprove that it is in fact a snuff film . so he sets off on a journey into the sordid underworld of sleaze to discover the truth about the film . the main problem with 8mm is that the whole film is completely pointless . welles is actually selected for the case by the old woman \\' s lawyer ( anthony heald , an actor who always plays the same type of character , that being a bad guy ) . when you first see him , your first instinct is that he \\' s behind the whole thing . the choice of casting does the film in . then , as welles begins his investigation , at times we will see a shadowy figure following him . the only person it could possibly be is the lawyer ( or someone sent by the lawyer ) because no one knows welles is even investigating anything yet . so your first instinct has now been confirmed . then , when it is in fact revealed that the lawyer is a part of the whole thing , he tells welles that he was chosen for the case because he was young and inexperienced ( in one of those ridiculous \" since we \\' re going to kill you anyway , why not tell you the whole thing \" moments ) . but earlier when we see welles being hired for the case he \\' s told that he was hired because he comes highly recommended . huh ? also , when the lawyer reveals himself to be a part of the whole thing , his main goal is to get the film back . so why did he give it up in the first place ? ! the lawyer had the film the whole time , then gave it away to the private detective thinking that he would just give up on the case and return the film ? ! it \\' s totally absurd . . . and this is the screenwriter of seven ? late in the film there \\' s a confrontation between all the main characters , and after a struggle one of the character \\' s guns ends up underneath a car . cage , who has been handcuffed to a bed , is rapidly trying to get to his gun , which is on a table . james gandolfini \\' s character goes for the gun under the car in what is supposed to be a scene of \" suspense \" . you see , the gun is just slightly out of reach from the side of the car he \\' s trying to reach it from , and so instead of going around the car to the other side ( where he can easily reach it ) he just keeps stretching . go around to the other side of the car ! ! this goes on for minutes . then , after cage gets his gun , gandolfini then decides it would be best to go around to the other side of the car . boy , schumacher is really really getting on my nerves . i think the final straw would be when cage returns home , devastated by everything that he \\' s seen on this case , and then is no longer able to rake his lawn ! we actually see a shot of him pathetically poking at leaves in his yard . other things that bugged me about 8mm : one would be the music , if you can call it that . whenever the score starts up , it sounds like techno music , and then this awful indian or middle eastern type music will accompany it . awful decision there joel . another is cage \\' s performance . at this point he \\' s capable of a wide range of performances , either good or bad . for 8mm , he delivers a very wooden one , and only shines when he \\' s interacting with joaquin phoenix ( who gives a great performance as a porn shop clerk with a heart of gold who helps cage with his case ) . you \\' re capable of much better mr . cage . now as for you mr . schumacher . . . i \\' m starting to doubt if you \\' re capable of anything else besides urinating onto the institution of american cinema .

       " ('\" you can \\' t have any of this . it \\' s all mine ! \" --- a twisted priest ( charles huevelman ) hordes his tasty fried chicken while dana ( angela zimmerly ) looks on uninterested . an evil presence , appropriately named the presence ( dj vivona ) , rules over an alternate dimension where neither angels nor demons can touch him . for kicks , the presence likes to trick a human into rounding up five of his or her friends so they can all be sent to his dimension and be systematically slaughtered . when something goes wrong and one of the presence \\' s recent victims escapes , the angels and demons are alerted to his existence and feel he is a threat that needs to be stopped . they enlist the help of alison ( ramona midgett ) , a recent suicide victim , to return to the flesh and follow the six new enlistees through the ice wall that surrounds the the nether - realm . her mission is to melt away the ice barrier and allow the angels and demons access by reminding the presence of who he once was , an ancient court jester named abraham who lost his job when his king and queen were killed . the king \\' s sorcerer , amblyn ( who also lost his job ) , decided to take abraham under his wing as an apprentice . during the downtime in his unemployment , amblyn decided to create a new dimension where sorcery , evil , and torture ruled . abraham wished to follow his master into this new realm , so he was asked to show his devotion to the evil wizard by murdering his one true love . in this new realm , amblyn would allow abraham to pursue the sport of hunting and destroying the humans that would be brought to this realm . after each murder , abraham would become stronger , until his power surpassed that of amblyn \\' s . because of the screw - up that allowed the recent escape , abraham was able to destroy his master and take control of the realm himself . as alison quests to find abraham and show him the errors of his ways , the six new hapless humans are allowed to live out their worst nightmares and then be brutally murdered . if there \\' s one thing i can \\' t stand when i see a film , it \\' s when the film is pretentious and arty just for the sake of being pretentious and arty . films like eraserhead and begotten are two of the worst examples of this , and now ice from the sun can be added to this list . this film is essentially an 80 minute stalk - and - slash film ( following the dante \\' s inferno idea that your hell corresponds to how you lived your life or any one of the plots to nightmare on elm street 3 through 6 ) intercut with almost 40 minutes of strange and ( supposedly ) haunting images , many of which serve more to confuse than to further the plot . if there aren \\' t bizarre images floating past the screen , then we get pointless shots of a suicidal alison staring at her breakfast for minutes at a time or contemplating whether or not she should answer her phone . compelling , but ultimately not . the opening credits sequence is designed like a music video for some unknown industrial band featuring various random images from the film interspersed with other random images . the credits run the entire length of the song which is almost five minutes and the actual cast listing and other credit information doesn \\' t pop up until near the end of the sequence . when the opening credits began i thought my vcr had accidentally cut off and a interstitial from mtv2 had found its way to my tv . at least the music in the film is pretty decent , made up of mostly industrial and hard rock music and even features a song by ramona midgett . at the beginning of the film it is established that the presence possesses supernatural powers like shooting bullets out of the palms of his hands and decapitating people by waving his hand in front of them ( and he talks like a darth vader clone without the heavy breathing ) . for some reason though , he delegates all of his main stalkings to what seems like the supporting cast of deliverance . one over - alled cretin handles the presence \\' s gravedigging and likes to chop peoples heads off with his shovel , then there \\' s an inbred father ( dwight spurgin ) and his two inbred children ( mark kettler and jennifer poirrier - wallace ) that take care of a young woman who has been transformed into a half dog - half human mix with a shotgun , and of course a big truck driving guy that likes to tie people up naked to the back of his vehicle and drag them across stone roads before pouring salt all over their wounds . why would you want to give responsibilities to a bunch of \" rednecks \" when you yourself had all of these cool powers ? and how is it that the fellow that screws over all of his buddies is able to round up exactly five friends to complete the number of people required to enter the realm at exactly the same time ? i can barely get more than two together all at once at any given moment . the most ridiculous segment though comes right before the aforementioned dragging / salting sequence . the character in question , dana ( angela zimmely ) , has her turn up to be killed and is standing at the front of a movie theater in which the presence is seated . a priest holding two naked dirty humans on leashes walks in and sits down next to a large platter of fried chicken . he picks up the entire platter and starts to enjoy the chicken , taunting dana as she looks on with no interest whatsoever . when she starts to leave , the priest chides her for going before the performance starts and then something that looks like a either a creature from a gwar show or a terry gilliam animation from monty python come to life , walks out , and makes like it wants to be crucified by her . the presence starts to clap annoyingly ( which continues for the rest of the sequence ) until dana takes off with the strange creature following her . when it finally catches up to her , she stabs it in its giant eyeball and is covered in slimy glop that spurts from the ruptured organ . the box for the film claims \" because of the horrifying nature of the motion picture , parental discretion is advised for persons under the age of 18 . contains nudity and graphic violence \" . while both is certainly true , there doesn \\' t seem to be much of either in any large amounts . besides a loving close up of a spurting neck stump , a semi - graphic self - surgery scene , and two instances of head trauma ( one run over and one melting ) , most of the gore is just of the spraying blood or bloody wound covered body variety . as for nudity , it is very sparse , but at least we get to see angela zimmerly ( far and away the most attractive cast member ) before her body is bruised , torn , and bloodied by the dragging incident . ice from the sun has been released on vhs by www . b - movie . com . it has been presented in in full - frame only and the transfer ( for a film shot a good deal in 8mm ) is pretty decent . besides the decent soundtrack ( which is also available from www . b - movie . com ) , a making - of video is also available called on thin ice . i haven \\' t had the opportunity to see the documentary , but i actually would have been interested to see what the set was like while all of the shots were being filmed , if only to see how director eric stanze ( director of a similar cult film called savage harvest ) , conducted the atmosphere on set .',\n",

       " ('contact is a film that tries to do several different things . it is intended to present a realistic picture of what alien contact might be like , to restore a sense of wonder and mystery to the issue of extraterrestrial life , to raise questions about science and faith and how they would be relevant in such a situation , and to tell a personal story of a romance between the astronomer dr . ellie arroway ( jodie foster ) and the religious spokesman palmer joss ( matthew mcconaughey ) . the film succeeds wonderfully at its first two goals . the portrayal of the communication from an alien world is much more reasonable ( albeit less immediately engaging ) than , say , the cold - blooded destructiveness of the invaders in independence day or even the complex process of abductions and genetic hybridization that forms the ongoing plot line of tv \\' s the x - files . the aliens in contact seem to be like us - they are more curious than anything else . they know we exist , they want us to know that they exist , and they would like to make the next step and communicate in person . the film wisely refrains from showing us the aliens directly , and between the characters \\' ongoing speculation about the extraterrestrials and the outstanding visuals in the climactic yet enigmatic scene when arroway arrives on the alien world , that sense of wonder and mystery comes through with a force rarely seen since stanley kubrick \\' s 2001 : a space odyssey . most of the film , however , takes place on earth , where there is an extended public debate on how to respond to these aliens . scientists are enthusiastic , ultraconservative religious leaders are wary , and government officials are caught somewhere in between . the debate is fueled largely by dr . arroway \\' s atheism ; she seems the obvious choice to pilot the spacecraft for which the aliens have provided blueprints , but many are wary of sending an atheist as humankind \\' s representative to another species . the film is partly successful in raising and exploring these questions , especially when it reaches a conclusion that suggests that the two approaches - science and faith - could be viewed as complementary rather than diametrically opposed . still , the film falls a little short in its representation of this conflict as it exists in american society . the two \" sides \" are represented primarily by arroway and by far - right fundamentalists , but in reality probably 80 % of americans are neither atheists nor far - right fundamentalists . palmer joss occupies something of a middle ground , but he ultimately becomes distracted by personal motives and comes across as a less - than - ideal spokesman for any ideology . then again , the film does concentrate mostly on public debate , which does , after all , tend to be dominated by extremists , rather than on dinner - table or college - dormitory discussions . contact is accurate in its portrayal of these issues , then , but only within the narrow scope to which it confines itself . the film \\' s one clear failure is in the portrayal of the romance between arroway and joss . for one thing , it resorts to the tired movie clich * that two attractive people will immediately fall in love as soon as they appear on the screen together , as there does not seem to be any other reason for their instant mutual attraction . the romance rarely , if ever , sheds any light on the characters , although it occasionally tries and fails - joss \\' s explanation that he quit the priesthood because of the celibacy requirement ( \" i guess you could say i \\' m a man of the cloth , but without the cloth \" ) , for example , is more like a punchline to a joke than character development . instead , the romance mostly seems to exist for the sake of later plot developments . granted , this is a plot - and idea - driven film and the characters are secondary , but this just seemed like laziness on the writers \\' part more than anything else . the successes of contact , however , far outweigh its failures . even if the social commentary had fizzled altogether ( which it didn \\' t ) , the simple yet mysterious story of alien communication still would have made it a memorable film . contact doesn \\' t quite cover all the bases , but it covers about as much as one could hope for in a two - hour film , and its rejection of big - budget theatrics for a more realistic story is certainly admirable . and i would not be surprised if , ten years from now , contact is mentioned in the same breath as 2001 and blade runner as one of the finest examples of sophisticated and intellectually relevant science fiction .',\n",

       " ('14 years ago , national lampoon introduced us to a new family - the griswolds . in 1983 , the griswolds embarked on a cross - country journey with the destination of wally world , a world - renowned theme park in california . we laughed our heads off as we shared the wild and crazy mishaps the family endured . two years later , we watched again as they went to europe , and four years after that , we shared christmas with them . now , eight more years have passed , and the laughs have done more than die . they \\' ve been cremated . vegas vacation brings back chevy chase as clark griswold , the good intentioned but ill - fated father of two . the premise is basically the same . clark has a wonderful idea to take his family on a bonding vacation , this time to las vegas . his wife ellen ( beverly d \\' angelo ) and teenage kids rusty and audrey ( always played by different actors - this time around , by ethan embry and marisol nichols , respectively ) join him and they soon find themselves in sin city where casinos will make the backdrop for ninety minutes of slapstick . of course a \" vacation \" movie wouldn \\' t be complete without good ole eddie ( reprised by randy quaid ) , the misfit cousin , showing up at all the wrong times . there isn \\' t too much of a plot here when it comes right down to it . it \\' s really just a skit movie . there are a couple of ways to define a skit movie , which is not a real term as far as i know . the first would be a movie that basically has one running gag for two hours , therefore coming off like a two hour skit . the second would be a movie that seems comprised of about twenty shorter skits , each lasting about five minutes . vegas vacation comes off like the first . a good example of the latter would be last year \\' s black sheep . the problem with this format is that it becomes old fast , and it doesn \\' t really fit into a movie mold . in these cases , a \" plot \" , which is generally very thin , is used either as a shameless filler between scenes or to simply add convenience to the gags ( i . e . have a good vegas joke , make a vegas movie ) . such is the case with this movie \\' s mini - plots . clark gets gambling fever and begins spending all of the griswold \\' s money , ellen is on the verge of an affair with wayne newton ( ! ) , rusty has a fake id and is using it to his gambling advantage , and audrey is desperate for fun and winds up joining her cousin vickie ( shae d \\' lyn ) as an exotic dancer . the simple fact is : this movie isn \\' t funny . at first , i did find myself chuckling heartily at a couple of little jokes , but when the movie got rolling , my interest suddenly stopped . chase plays clark griswold really well . he made the character and he is the character . d \\' angelo , to be quite honest , never was too impressive as ellen , and this movie doesn \\' t show any signs of redemption . as for the two new griswold kids , the word \" blah \" comes to mind . the \" vacation \" series seems out to prove that anybody can play these two characters , the simple reason being that there is nothing to them . they \\' re so generic , you \\' ll expect the credits to read \" girl # 1 as audrey griswold \" . vegas vacation differs from the first three in the series by more than just laugh factor . yes , it \\' s true that vegas vacation isn \\' t even close to being close to being as funny as the others , which were actually pretty fun in their own doofy ways , but there are a couple of other things that set this one negatively apart . first off , why did they leave off the national lampoon \\' s heading on the title ? i couldn \\' t find any reasons why , but maybe the fact is even national lampoon didn \\' t want to be associated with such a lame film . that \\' s saying a lot , especially when you look at what else the company has proudly presented : loaded weapon 1 , pcu , etc . if they expected this to be another hit , you would assume they \\' d be proud to tack on the notorious header , but for reasons only we can guess at , like the movie sucking , they didn \\' t . there is another difference here that makes an obvious impact . the first three films in the \" vacation \" series were written by john hughes , a talented writer who is behind several popular films of the 80 \\' s including mr . mom , sixteen candles , the breakfast club , weird science , pretty in pink , ferris bueller \\' s day off , planes , trains , and automobiles , and uncle buck . wowzers ! what a r ? sum ? ! looking at the names , you \\' d think this guy wrote everything that now stands as a movie icon for the 1980 \\' s . well that \\' s not all . this guy also brought us 90 \\' s hits including the home alone series , the remake of 101 dalmatians , dennis the menace , and the current flubber . vegas vacation , however , didn \\' t have john hughes behind it , and the loss is very obvious . this time around , the script is in the hands of elisa bell , whose only credits thus far include four made - for - tv movies . vegas vacation plays very much like one , and it would actually work much better as a made - for - tv sequel . if this sounds like a wild idea , it \\' s not . revenge of the nerds third and fourth installments were both television movies , and they seemed like it . vegas vacation would fit in well on the fox network as a 2 : 00 a . m . sunday morning movie , but as a silver screen major motion picture , it \\' s quite out of place . stephen kessler \\' s jejune direction doesn \\' t help things either . he only makes the film even more tv - movie - ish . each consecutive \" vacation \" movie has suffered a drop in directing power . we started the series off with harold ramis , who also directed caddyshack and groundhog day as well as co - writing ghostbusters . not too bad . then we had national lampoon \\' s european vacation being directed by amy heckerling , who would go on to direct the hits look who \\' s talking and clueless , as well as having already directed the infamous fast times at ridgemont high . lastly we had national lampoon \\' s christmas vacation , directed by jeremiah s . chechik , who went on to direct the charming benny & joon . kessler , so far , has one title under his belt , the short film birch street gym , which received an oscar nomination in 1992 . granted that this was his first attempt at a feature length film , we can allow for some amateurish quality , but instead we get a movie straight from the text book - boring , bland , and deeply unoriginal . if you loved the \" vacation \" movies , and i know * some * of us did , there still isn \\' t anything here worth seeing . if you loved them , don \\' t ruin your good impressions of the series by indulging in this tragic example of cinema ala carte . if you never did like the series , why the need to confirm why ?',\n",

       " ('\" i \\' d rather die today and go to heaven than live to be a hundred and go to hell , \" earnestly proclaims the pentecostal preacher . with that line coming from a fundamentalist christian minister , hollywood has taught us how we should fill in the rest of the story . he will be turn out to be a scoundrel who has less actual belief in god than the average american , and all of his preaching will turn out to be a cynical ruse to extort money from his naive congregation . from elmer gantry on , we have learned what to expect when the movies go to church . well , think again , for the apostle , which robert duvall has wanted to make for over a decade , does not take the usual tack of smearing the minister , and by implication all , the rest of organized religion . instead it gives us a highly devout man , who certainly has his foibles , but with an absolute dedication to his ministry and his god . and arguably just as surprising , the good - spirited film is no comedy , even if it does have humorous moments . instead of levity the picture takes a touchingly serious approach as it introduces us to a world not normally seen in motion pictures . when in the privacy of his attic , robert duvall , as texas preacher euliss \" sonny \" dewey , argues sternly with his lord , the scene shares a kinship with emily watson \\' s character crying out for her god in breaking the waves \\' s most powerful scene . the body of the story starts with sonny \\' s coming upon an horrific auto accident , which is another part of life generally ignored by modern screenwriters . with his well worn bible in hand , sonny leaps from his car so that he can go pray over and with the accident \\' s dying victims . the scowling police officer orders him to go away , and , after he has tried to work his miracles , sonny leaves with a smile in the confidence that he has done the lord \\' s work . robert duvall not only gives a moving and realistic performance surely destined to receive an academy award nomination but is also the film \\' s director , writer , executive producer , and chief financier . rarely has a movie been such a labor of love . with a white suit , peach - colored shirt and tie , and dark sunglasses , sonny looks as much like a rock star as a preacher . duvall has every movement down pat . even when he is walking down the street , the ever strutting sonny cannot contain his energy . he dances and claps all the way . sonny \\' s churches having more black members than white means that he shares his preaching duties with many deep - voiced black orators , but his rhetoric is always competitive . \" i may be on the devil \\' s hit - list , but i \\' m on god \\' s mailing list , \" he shouts to the congregation in a revival tent . and they lap it up . people jump up , scream , \" praise the lord ! \" and mean it . the intensity of their shared religious experience is palpable . but sonny is no saint . it turns out that he has a wandering eye , which angers his wife jessie , played in a remarkably controlled performance by farrah fawcett . jessie gets her revenge by taking up with the church \\' s youth minister and conniving to gain control over sonny \\' s church , leaving him unemployed . sonny , letting his temper get the best of him , does something foolish , which causes him to have to leave town and two beloved kids forever . the bulk of the film occurs in a small , predominately black church in louisiana , which he builds up from a derelict building with no congregation into a remodeled church ( \" one way road to heaven : holiness temple \" ) with an enthusiastic flock . in this part he rebaptizes himself as the apostle e . f . the apostle is a hard worker willing to take on any odd job necessary to obtain the funds for his church . he asks his members to tithe , but he gives all of his money . and his good deeds extend to secret donations of food for the local poor folks . a man who can \\' t stand to be still , he tells one of his friends , \" i quit school because i didn \\' t like recess . \" in his new town he meets toosie ( miranda richardson ) , who , like him , has a family that she hasn \\' t seen in a while . his romance with the separated woman , like the rest of the film , doesn \\' t follow the standard patterns we have grown to expect from our movies . billy bob thornton shows up one day playing a local racist and general troublemaker . his confrontation with the apostle is yet another of show \\' s many surprising scenes , again breaking many rules and conceptions about what approach deeply religious people might take . although it probably couldn \\' t have ended any other way , the movie does wrap things up nicely . and don \\' t miss the sweet epilogue during the film \\' s closing credits . a tour de force acting performance by duvall and a surprising and unrelentingly dedicated script makes for an outstanding and moving film . the apostle runs a little too long at 2 : 12 . it is rated pg - 13 for mild profanity and brief violence and would be fine for kids eleven and up .',\n",

( in one unintentionally ( ? ) hilarious sequence , nasa asks harry to inspect a deep - core driller they built based on his blueprints ; it is poorly constructed - harry criticizes almost every aspect of it . we trust nasa to build space shuttles ? ) harry assembles the obligatory \" ragtag \" bunch of \" cowboys \" , including a blond guy , a fat guy , a black guy , a wiseass , and the man who is sleeping with his daughter ( affleck ) . once they reach space , we experience sequence after sequence of something going wrong - perhaps the fact that they sent a bunch of nincompoops into outer space has something to do with it ; i cannot count the number of times they almost fail the mission on all my fingers and toes . whether or not they save the day , i will not reveal . nor will you care . i will say this : you know you \\' re in trouble when deep impact dwarfs your asteroid movie in terms of emotion and scope . willis has barely a chance to come alive ; ditto for affleck . their big scenes are mostly reserved for the third act , in a last minute - and futile - attempt to inject warmth into the material . steve buscemi \\' s character - the wiseass - is exceptionally problematic . \" rockhound \" , as he \\' s called , is sarcastic and foolish , so they tape him to a chair , where he spends most of the film . so why did they bring him up there to begin with ? rather , why write him into the film ? - give his almost - witty one - liners to serious willis , who scowls and mopes and demonstrates psychotic tendencies : at one point he chases after affleck with his shotgun for screwing his daughter , firing often and causing significant damage to his oil rig . i \\' m guessing he qualifies under nasa guidelines as someone unfit for space travel , at least in my world where the sky is blue . liv tyler is pretty and humourless , as always ; suspiciously , four of her father \\' s band \\' s ( \" aerosmith \" ) songs grace the soundtrack . director michael bay lays the visual and sound effects on thick , like ketchup , eventually drowning the movie on - screen . ( the middle hour is a non - sensical , pyrotechnic assault on the average primate \\' s brain . ) whenever someone dies in this movie , a crew member inevitably yells out \" we lost ( insert dead person \\' s last name here ) ! \" i must admit that not once could i distinguish a dead oil - guy - cum - astronaut from a live one , and close - ups of the corpses \\' faces beneath cracked helmets provided little assistance , as their skin was often covered in fake blood . armageddon is not as terrible movie as godzilla . it looks nicer , and has fewer plot - holes within its equally ludicrous framework . it has a vivid soundmix . but at almost two - and - a - half hours , i could not believe how little actually happened over the course of the story . the love story has been played up in the ads , perhaps hoping to catch people before they recover from titanic - fever . bollocks ! the lovers in the film are miles apart throughout - erase all thoughts of nude sketching or car - sex and replace them with obligatory shots of liv tyler tearing up while ben affleck dicks around in a moon - crawler . remember a little film called jaws ? in this film , three independent - minded men suddenly found themselves on a fishing boat in pursuit of a deadly shark . they didn \\' t much like each other at first ; eventually , they started to respect one another . one of jaws \\' great scenes involved the would - be - ahabs drinking and singing songs and telling stories . this is the sort of male - bonding foreign to bay or his producer , jerry bruckheimer , who throw too many characters into the mix and expect we \\' ll care about them on the grounds that the world is about to end . not once do we get the feeling that these characters are even acquaintances - i \\' d be surprised if these actors bothered to introduce themselves to one another before \" action \" was called . a male friend who loved the film suggested to me that perhaps i cannot relate to a bunch of men who don \\' t bare their souls , who believe in dying macho concepts like heroism and a kind of chest - beating bravery . to this , i will respond that the boys in armageddon are neither heroic , nor brave , nor smart , even : this team couldn \\' t build a birdhouse . and if i get no respect for disliking a movie with all the synthetic feeling of a trailer - a trailer for a movie written by a team of body - builders and greeting card authors - i \\' ve never been a prouder wimp my whole life .',\n",

       " ('plot summary : the year is 2024 . the ozone layer has long since gone and the earth is now protected from radiation by a shield invented by connor mccleod . the shield , although saving lives , has made the atmosphere hot and humid . connor is a mortal and a tired old man who has given up hope . on returning from the opera one night connor is accosted by the leader of a \" terrorist \" organisation . they have tried to find out what the company that now runs the shield unit are covering up . connor is then attacked by two assassins sent by katana from the planet zeist ( like zeit -- get it ? ) . they fail and connor becomes immortal again by chopping their heads off . he then brings ramirez back to life in glencoe in scotland . both ramirez and connor are rebel leaders back on zeist and have been sent to earth as punishment . connor now has the option to return being the last one but opts to stay with his new found immortality and fight to find out about the company and the shield . katana meanwhile , fearing connor would return , sets out himself to kill the highlander . if you have never seen it . being a fan of highlander and mr . connery , i was in the cinema as soon as i could to see highlander ii : the quickening . i wish it had been quicker . i feel whatever else you can say about a film ( bad script bad music , etc . ) if you sit just plain bored through most of it then nothing much else needs to be said . the film was short but in my opinion only twelve minutes or so ( the time mr . connery is on the screen for ) is worth watching . the plot sounds a little ridiculous but i was willing to give it a chance . maybe they could pull it off . instead , i find that the characters have completely changed from those in the first film . it \\' s as if they are different people with the same names . witness connor jumping into bed with the leader of the resistance -- where is the attitude of \" who wants to live forever , when love must die \" gone to ? the love sub - plot * must * have had footage cut out . the highlander and ramirez both seemed aware of powers they had never mentioned before . putting our heroes in deadly situations and then having them walk away because of some new power is very annoying . i still want to know why connor \\' s coat becomes flame proof when he is immortal ! we are not given enough time on zeist to believe in it , nor are we told why advanced aliens still use swords to kill . why not dynamite or laser saws or just plain bullets followed by a quick chop to the neck ? i know the head needs to come off but you could at least immobilise your opponent with laser rifles first . to be fair one assassin tried this but he must be the world \\' s worst shot . meanwhile connor develops luke - skywalker - like powers of laser beam deflection . as for \" bad guys , \" we see a rebellion on zeist , crushed easier than a grape and then the rest of the plot depends on katana being obsessed with killing mccleod in case he returns to zeist . two assassins are sent , presumably they are meant to be good at killing but an aged connor kills them both with no problems . no more assassins are sent . katana , supposedly a very powerful man goes himself to kill connor . has he no more assassins ? has he no better ? why was the rebellion crushed so easily then ? michael ironside is totally unconvincing ( bring back the kurgan ) . he seems like a cartoon character and really isn \\' t that evil , just stupid and violent . we see the hollywood trick of the chief nasty threatening a child again and killing lots of innocents . yet he still seems like no threat -- perhaps because he seems too stupid to threaten connor , or maybe because his two best assassins wouldn \\' t have been amiss with larry , curly and mo . so much for plot and characters . the music is atrocious . it is at best intrusive and at worst annoying . bring back queen . there was an audible sigh ( of relief ? ) when connor played a queen track in a juke box . i believe this at least is to be corrected for the american release . the acting is at best flat , except for mr . connery . lambert is uninteresting and when he delivered \" there can be only one \" this time around it just made me wish there had only been one -- highlander . michael ironside is unconvincing ; sorry , michael , i usually like you and everyone else was incredibly forgetable . so why 2 / 10 ? visually the film is interesting at all times . it has a blade runner feel to it and some of the special effects are quite stunning . add to this an irrepressible sean connery who smiles throughout the whole film -- or is he smirking to himself ? his lines and delivery might make the film worthwhile had it not been so obvious that he cannot take the whole thing seriously at all but hey -- * i \\' d * have done it for 12 million . oh , and i agree with a previous reviewer , she * does * look like sharon stone but i believe it is her first film . incidentally there is a line producer credited and i hear rumours of highlander iii : the wizard .',\n",

       " ('from a major league baseball radio broadcast , featuring play - by - play man harry canary and color man whitey hashbrown , with special guest commentator james berardinelli . hc : as we go to the top of the 8th , we \\' re joined in the booth by film critic james berardinelli , who \\' s here fresh from seeing the new baseball movie , major league : back to the minors , the third in the popular saga taking a lighter look at the majors . nice to see you , jim . as a big baseball fan and a movie reviewer , can you give us the scoop on the new flick ? jb : my opinion : the producers should have stopped while they were ahead , and that was nine years ago . one entry was definitely enough , and i \\' m surprised there was a third after the anemic showing and low quality of major league 2 . this latest installment has all the earmarks of something that should have been released direct - to - video . it \\' s worse than a mediocre made - for - tv feature . i should also mention that this movie likely won \\' t play all that well in cleveland . now that the real indians are perennial contenders , they have been replaced by the minnesota twins as the cinematic sadsacks . actually , most of the action involves the twins \\' aaa minor league club , the buzz , rather than the actual major league franchise . hc : sorry to interrupt , jim , but we still have to do play - by - play for the game on the field . leading off this inning is john warren . he steps into the batter \\' s box and takes kent \\' s pitch low for ball one . wh : so , the story \\' s strictly minor league , right ? what \\' s it about ? jb : scott bakula , the guy from quantum leap , plays career minor league pitcher gus cantrell . when twins owner roger dorn , once again portrayed by corbin bernsen , needs a new manager for his aaa team , he offers the job to gus , who is now faced with two daunting tasks : turn the team around and groom hot prospect downtown anderson ( played by walt goggins ) for a promotion to \" the show . \" with the help of former major leaguers pedro cerrano ( dennis haysbert ) , rube baker ( eric bruskotter ) , and isuro tanaka ( takaaki ishibashi ) , gus gets the buzz on the right track . in fact , he is so successful that he earns the enmity of the jealous manager of the big - league club , leonard huff ( played with over - the - top relish by ted mcginley ) . soon , dorn has arranged an exhibition game that pits gus \\' overachieving group against huff \\' s overpaid , last - place bunch . wh : can we guess who wins ? jb : the results have all the suspense of watching the videotape of a game when you \\' ve already seen the box score . on top of that , none of the mock - ups are presented with much flair . they \\' re not just boring ; they \\' re lackluster . but the major league movies have never been about drama or tension ; they \\' ve been about using baseball situations to generate laughs . hc : warren fouls off a fastball . 1 and 1 . wh : are there lots of yuks in this one ? jb : not one , from start to finish . i enjoyed the first major league because it was reasonably fresh and funny . okay , a lot of the jokes were sophomoric , but they made me laugh . the two sequels haven \\' t just been stale , but their humor quotient has been abysmally low . even bob uecker \\' s once - sharp one - liners have turned lame , and they \\' re the closest the film comes to being even vaguely amusing . hc : here \\' s the 1 - 1 pitch . looooooong drive ? fair or foul ? foul ball ! the count goes to 1 and 2 . wh : does the film at least get the baseball details correct ? jb : yes . there aren \\' t any glaring errors like there were in one of the best - ever baseball movies , the natural . but i \\' d gladly trade a technically accurate film for one with a good story , believable characters , or even a little genuine humor . heck , the naked gun is a better baseball comedy than major league : back to the minors . wh : it \\' s nice to see old friends one more time , isn \\' t it ? like cerrano , tanaka , and dorn . jb : depends on whether you really care that anyone is back . there aren \\' t any real characters here ? just an assortment of cliched oddballs . yeah , the voodoo hitter , the catcher who can \\' t throw back to the pitcher , the japanese player , and the conceited player - turned - owner have all returned , but who really cares ? they have no depth . notable absences include tom berenger \\' s veteran and charlie sheen \\' s \" wild thing . \" we don \\' t really miss them , though . hc : breaking ball , low and outside . 2 and 2 . wh : so you \\' re saying that we should give this one a miss ? jb : that \\' s right . to use baseball terminology , it \\' s a three - pitch strikeout . if you \\' re looking for a good movie that involves baseball , try popping the natural , field of dreams , bull durham , or even the first major league into the vcr . actually , this is an oddly - timed release , since baseball fans are likely to be spending more time in parks than in theaters . even the minor league seasons are already underway . don \\' t bother with major league : back to the minors . it \\' s a wretched time - waster . wh : thanks for the advice . jb : you \\' re welcome . hc : and here \\' s the 2 - 2 pitch . fouled back , right into this booth . hey , jim , heads up ! oops . somebody better get him some ice for that . he may be good at deflecting bad baseball movies , but he needs to learn not to duck into foul balls . odd how warren seemed to aim that ball right at him , almost as if he has a grudge to settle . anyway , back to the action on the field ?',\n",

( i stopped looking at my wife during the screening , since every time i did , she \\' d start sticking her finger in her throat . and she \\' s right , it is that bad . ) directed without any imagination by steve boyum , whose long background in film is mainly in stunts and in second unit direction , the film limps along at best . boyum attempts to keep the pace moving by staging stunts , stunts and more stunts . amazingly for someone with his background , he seems incapable of finding any fresh ones , and we have a car go off the road five different times -- maybe more . but who \\' s counting ? and then there is the script by james herzfeld , whose only other film , tapeheads from a decade ago , was so awful that it is considered a cult classic . meet the deedles , however , is painfully bad rather than laughably bad . it will probably be in and out of the theaters like a tornado and is in no danger of becoming a classic anything . herzfeld treats us to gratingly abysmal dialog that includes \" your geyser \\' s a geezer , \" and \" i \\' d like to put a deedle in her haystack . \" as the movie opens , the twins , who at one point describe themselves modestly as \" a walking kodak moment , \" are celebrating their 18th birthday . as they ride a parasail high above the waters of waikiki , a truant officer pursues them on his jet ski . as heirs to the fabulous fortune of the deedle empire , the boys are sent by their father to camp broken spirit at yellowstone to transform the two laid - back beach bums into men . as they arrive in their wetsuits in yellowstone , they \\' ve got their surfboards , skateboards , and a hawaiian drink machine the size of an armoire . their camp has gone out of business , but they are mistaken for new park rangers . the rest of the movie has them fighting the park \\' s overpopulation of prairie dogs as well as a deranged ex - ranger , played by dennis hopper , who is out to stop old faithful before its billionth birthday celebration , scheduled for later in the week . hopper , who has made some wonderful movies , carried away being a recent favorite , does have a propensity for choosing some truly odoriferous material . this isn \\' t his worst acting , but meet the deedles is arguably the worst movie he \\' s ever been in . steve van wormer and paul walker , as stew and phil , give lifeless performances . the only actor in the movie with any demonstrable talent is a cute little prairie dog named petey . even the cinematography by david hennings is so prosaic that it manages to make yellowstone look dull . to add insult to injury , hennings is fond of inappropriate close - ups , which only serve to remind us of the inanity of the dialog . put a ten - foot pair of lips on the screen , and you naturally pay extra attention to what is said . although boyum says in the notes that he is proud that his film is appropriate for families , one wonders how many skateboarders will attempt the movie \\' s stunt of lying on your back on a skateboard while negotiating a busy and twisting mountain road . they make it look like so much fun that i \\' m sure many will try some variation of the stunt . \" how could this possibly be worst , \" asks phil . just when you suspect it can \\' t , the movie takes a turn further downhill . its low point may have you looking for an airline barf bag . after phil \\' s girlfriend digs up a big mount of moist soil , they suck in a long worm . like the two dog lovers eating spaghetti in lady and the tramp , their lips finally meet in a kiss . as they pull back , their faces are full of the dirt that encased the worm they have just ingested . meet the deedles runs about an hour and a half . it is rated pg for a little bathroom humor and would be acceptable for kids around 6 and up . my son jeffrey and his friend nickolas , both almost 9 , gave the show * * * . they both thought the scenes with petey were among their favorites . nickolas also mentioned the scene in which the circus bear drives a jeep , and jeffrey especially liked the one in which the circus elephant was referred to as dumbo .',\n",

( glass has a small cameo as a keyboardist for the show . ) and the pacing of the story was brisk . there was no unnecessarily long setup explaining the concept behind the truman show , just a few quick title cards , a few interviews , and then right into the show , and the movie . one of the first scenes is of the studio light falling ; there was no token scene of truman \\' s idyllic life before it falls apart , because it wasn \\' t necessary , we pick up the story at the first sign of trouble , and no sooner . there \\' s also no point in the movie where the plot slows down . it \\' s a quick , straight shot to the movie \\' s end . in terms of overall quality , i would compare the truman show to niccol \\' s gattaca . both films are well made with interesting stories set in interesting worlds . but neither film really felt like it capitalized on all the great ideas ; neither film \" clicked \" and became an instant classic . nevertheless , i look forward to niccol \\' s next film , whatever it may be .',\n",

       " ('\" when you get out of jail , you can kill him . \" starring ashley judd , tommy lee jones , bruce greenwood . rated r . double jeopardy is a lurid , prepostrous thriller that \\' s also one of the year \\' s most enjoyable . it \\' s an uncompromisingly brutal , cheerfully anarchic , hyperactive actioner that has a mission and never diverts from it . there is not a moment here when the events on screen don \\' t have a direct bearing on the plot ; once the film gets going it never stops . it has been branded as the female version of the fugitive and that \\' s probably a correct assessment of the plot , but the film itself has little in common with the 1993 andrew davis / harrison ford collaboration besides the presence of star tommy lee jones . not even bothering with character introduction , director bruce beresford floors the gas pedal from the get - go and never finds the brake . we meet , rather hastily , libby and nick parsons ( ashley judd and bruce greenwood , respectively ) a seemingly happy married couple , with a son matty , age 4 . they go out on a sailboat one night , and after a period of some rockin \\' sex , they go to sleep . libby hears a strange noise , wakes up and discovers that she is covered with blood . she follows a red trail to the upper deck , where she finds a knife and , out of astonishment , picks it up . at that convenient moment , the coast guard shows up and libby is arrested . her lawyer , a friend , puts up a defense in court , but though we know she is innocent , the evidence against her is too compelling . her friend adopts her son and she goes to prison . once in prison , she makes a phone call to her friend . her friend gives her son the phone . nick walks in the room . little matty screams \" daddy ! \" the phone goes dead . libby realizes that the man she is imprisoned for killing isn \\' t even dead . she gets some advice from a prisoner / former lawyer , who tells her that since the state already convicted her of killing her husband , they can \\' t convict her of the same crime again , meaning that when she gets paroled she can kill him and they can \\' t touch her . after a weirdly short amount of time , she gets out of parole . she is sent to live at a house with other recent parolees , under the command of parole officer travis lehman ( tommy lee jones ) . she sets out on a mission to find her husband and get her son back , which turns out to be much more difficult than anticipated . she winds up tracking him all the way to new orleans where she finds out that he has long killed his girlfriend and her son \\' s \" adopter \" . double jeopardy is based on an assumption that is legally false . the law stating that nobody can be convicted twice for the same crime assumes that it is the same crime : same time , same place , same circumstances . it \\' s not like it matters . this is a rollickingly good thriller ; intense , exciting , fast and furious . it \\' s silly alright , but this is the kind of film you just don \\' t question . in some films , plausibility is everything . double jeopardy , however , is not concerned with making sense : its sole purpose is to entertain , and it does . judd helps the film tremendously in a difficult role . this is her breakout box - office performance , and she is terrific . she brings some emotion to what could have been a one - dimensional role , giving the movie a little soul to go along with its effective chase scenes and action set pieces . tommy lee jones basically just reprises the role for which he won an oscar in the fugitive , but the movie makes good use of his stone - faced wit . thankfully , too , double jeopardy refrains from developing a romance between libby and travis ; a subplot which doubtlessly would have interfered with the film \\' s story . this is one of those movies where cops are the bad guys , and i took a sort of sick pleasure in that . the sheer anarchy of the proceedings was nothing short of wonderful , as ashley judd kicks the crap out of every authority figure in the book . after all the idealistic hollywood features featuring hero cops , deft fbi agents and the virtues of the american legal system , it \\' s great to see a movie that doesn \\' t so much demonstrate their fallacy as it delights in their failure . double jeopardy is really good , but it isn \\' t the kind of good that is remembered or recognized with awards . it \\' s one of those movies better viewed with the brain turned off , otherwise , your brain will be busy ruining your experience . this is a thriller that isn \\' t concerned with being smart or plausible . instead it diverts all attention to the action , which , this year , is second to none .',\n",

       " (\"several days after having seen this movie , i ' m still trying to determine what director christopher guest , a man whose sense of humor i usually appreciate , found funny in either the concept or the execution of almost heroes . this is a dreadful motion picture ? a lowbrow example of period piece comedy with terrible production values and an exceptionally poor laughs - to - jokes ratio . there ' s a kind of desperation in the movie ' s approach to humor that reveals the film makers ' uncertainty about how entertaining the material is ; the manic style betrays itself as a last - ditch attempt to hide the flaws of a failed script . the premise doesn ' t sound especially amusing to begin with ? almost heroes tells the tale of two explorers , the effeminate leslie edwards ( matthew perry ) and the uncouth bartholomew hunt ( chris farley ) , who are racing lewis and clark on the trip to the american northwest . edwards and hunt are accompanied by the kinds of weirdoes we find in road movies ( albeit of the early - 19th century variety ) , including a frenchman named guy fontenot who claims to speak hundreds of languages ( none of which prove to be useful ) , a pretty indian maiden who turns into the obligatory love interest , and a bizarre man who suffers a series of debilitating injuries . along the way , the intrepid explorers encounter bears , bald eagles , aging native american warriors , and a conquistador named hildago ( kevin dunn ) who raves about his beautiful hair . the explorers ' trek takes them through forests , across the snow - capped rocky mountains , and over a waterfall . this setup leads to a lot of shouting , a great deal of lunacy , and very few laughs . farley engages in his usual shtick of falling down and bellowing , but , aside from an momentarily diverting confrontation with an eagle , his heart doesn ' t seem to be in it . matthew perry , one of the stars of tv ' s friends ( who had some modest success in the romantic comedy , fools rush in ) is badly miscast . as a foil for farley and an antidote to his runaway energy , perry lacks the necessary edge of the proverbial straight man . i ' m not a big fan of david spade , and i didn ' t like tommy boy , but at least he and farley worked well together . as far as the supporting players go , none of them makes more than a fleeting impression . eugene levy is wasted , and kevin dunn is about as interesting here as he is in godzilla . frankly , it ' s a disappointment to see something this dumb and ugly come from christopher guest , the brilliant comic force behind such films as this is spinal tap , the big picture , and waiting for guffman . although guest gets the costumes right , this nearly - inconsequential success is no substitute for the weak script and unfunny execution . the special effects , such as they are , are execrable . for an example of some really poor blue screen work , look at the scenes where the characters are shooting the rapids ( they ' re obviously getting buckets of water thrown on them ) and where farley is being carried off by an eagle . even though farley didn ' t have the most stellar of acting careers , he doesn ' t deserve the kind of unfortunate epitaph offered by almost heroes . while some of the more outrageous attempts at humor may coax a few guffaws from 12 - year old boys , the level of comedy in almost heroes falls far below the level of sophomoric . farley fans who see this film as a way to say goodbye should be commended for their loyalty , since it takes real stamina to stay seated for the full running length of this cinematic torture session .\",\n",

even whit stillman \\' s _the_last_days_of_disco_ , which wasn \\' t so much concerned with disco as it was witty dialogue within a group of hip - to - only - themselves club - hopping preppies , featured at least one extended dance scene . dancing isn \\' t the only thing glazed over in _54_ -- so is the sex , but that may not be entirely christopher \\' s fault . from what i \\' ve heard , his original vision was something considerably more dark and daring , starting with the shane character : he was conceived ( and actually filmed ) as a wild , morally ambiguous bisexual , which would have made an efficient springboard to cover the pansexual pleasure palace aspect of studio 54 \\' s legend . but somewhere between principal photography and the final cut , shane was defanged and quite literally straightened out ; consequently , so was the film . aside from a brief glimpse of erotic encounters toward the beginning of the film , shane \\' s fleeting dalliance with seductive socialite billie ( sela ward ) , and an abbreviated bedhopping montage , the sexual dimension is just about ignored . shane , in this incarnation , is sanitized to the point of blandness , an idealistic do - gooder who pines for a frequent guest at the club , julie black ( campbell ) , a worldly soap star with , yes , a heart of gold . this tacked - on \" romance \" would have been slightly less tedious if either campbell or phillippe made some connection with each other or the audience . they fail on both counts . ultimately , _54_ \\' s failure comes down to three letters : f - u - n . as in , there isn \\' t any to be had for the audience . too much time is spent with the boring shane , and too little is spent on the club floor , where all the action took place . anyhow , though , whatever time is spent on the 54 floor is not used very effectively . when anita finally gets her big break and perform onstage at the club , it should be a euphoric height , for her , the crowd , and the audience ; however , the moment doesn \\' t get a chance to reach that level , for it is cut short by a moment of forced sentimentality , which also mars the film \\' s conclusion ( one of the last - minute reshoots ) . strangely upbeat and wistful , the resolution is wholly unconvincing and unsatisfying . there is an interesting portrait of studio 54 out there -- two of them , in fact -- but _54_ is not one of them . they \\' re on cable tv : a couple of documentaries produced by e ! and vh1 . these two fascinating looks at the club and all the sordid goings - on within it show that there \\' s still a great disco movie to be made . the problem is , after the critical and certain box office failure of _54_ , the subject may have run its hollywood course .',\n",

       " ('every once in a while , when an exceptional family film comes along , i will attempt to champion it by challenging parents to put their money where their mouths have been ; with all the hubbub over the lack of films suitable for children , it is remarkable how many non - disney films disappear in a couple of weeks . now i see that in so doing , i have unfairly ghettoized these films . so i am issuing my challenge not just to parents , but to anyone who wants to support smart , funny , energetic film - making : see matilda . see it in a theater , rather than shrugging and waiting for it on video . see the best film i have seen in 1996 . not the best children \\' s film . . . the best film . period . based on a story by roald dahl , it tells of young matilda wormwood ( mara wilson ) , an extraordinarily bright girl whose great misfortune it is to have a pair of deeply stupid parents : harry ( danny devito ) , a crooked used car salesman ; and zinnia ( rhea perlman ) , a simple - minded bingo addict . the wormwoods barely notice matilda exists , and when they do , it is only to scold her for spending too much time reading books . when they finally do send her to school , it is to crunchem hall , a bleak place run by cruel , child - hating miss agatha trunchbull ( pam ferris ) . but things begin to look up for matilda when she discovers a sympathetic teacher , miss honey ( embeth davidtz ) , who nurtures her natural inquisitiveness . matilda also discovers another special talent -- the ability to move things with her mind -- which allows her to help herself and miss honey to overcome miss trunchbull \\' s cruelty . it was this spring \\' s james and the giant peach which inspired me to note that the best and most lasting tales for children tended to have more than a hint of darkness to them , and you can bet that the roald dahl responsible for the gleeful ghoulishness of james and willy wonka and the chocolate factory has more of the same in store with matilda . and just as james benefited from the dark sensibilities of henry selick and tim burton , matilda soars on the cock - eyed direction of danny devito . devito made black humor a key element in throw momma from the train and the war of the roses , and he contributes some memorable images . in one scene , an unfortunate girl is made an example of by miss trunchbull when she is picked up by her pig - tails and flung through the air like a throwing hammer ; later , an overweight boy is forced to eat an entire massive cake after he is caught stealing a dessert . matilda is just twisted enough to be a perfect fairy tale . it is also characteristic of the best children \\' s tales that they manage to teach lessons in such a way that children almost don \\' t realize that they are learning them . there is a hilarious moment when matilda \\' s television - addicted father snatches away the book she is reading ( in a wicked joke , he thinks _moby dick_ is pornographic ) and forces her to watch an inane game show ( hosted by jon lovitz ) in which contestants are smeared with adhesive and placed in a booth filled with cash blowing around . matilda is a story which promotes the value of intellectual curiosity over passive entertainment , and it does so while poking holes in that most frustrating of notions for a child -- that because \" i \\' m big and you \\' re little , i \\' m right and you \\' re wrong . \" more specifically , it has as its heroine an intelligent , self - confident girl who struggles successfully against other people \\' s notions of how she should behave . it is no coincidence that matilda was co - written by robin swicord , who contributed the superb recent adaptation of little women . finally , matilda has that quality i find rarest and most treasured in family entertainment : it is family entertainment in the truest sense of the word . devito knows enough to make matilda fast - paced and appealing to children , taking a deliciously nasty performance by pam ferris as miss trunchbull and making it the focal point of some priceless physical comedy , including a great chase through her dark house . the child actors are winning but never obnoxiously adorable , with mara wilson making matilda a clever and extremely likeable character . but there are also many , many delights for adults , including my favorite scene in which matilda uses her powers to frighten miss trunchbull by having chalk write on a chalkboard by itself while matilda \\' s classmates recite in sing - song fashion ; there is also a deadpan cameo by paul reubens as an fbi agent staking out matilda \\' s father . i can \\' t imagine anyone of any age leaving matilda feeling as though his or her intelligence had been insulted . matilda is a film which left me glowing with good feeling . i will see it again , and years from now i will watch it with my children . and now i will stop , because somewhere near you matilda is about to begin , and there is a seat in that theater you should be in , if you have a child or ever were a child .',\n",

       " ('nosferatu the vampyre ( germany 1979 ) a film review by mike watson copyright 1999 mike watson this extraordinary re - telling of bram stoker \\' s \" dracula \" by german filmmaker werner herzog deserves the most prominent of places in cinematic vampire lore . inspired by f . w . murnau \\' s 1922 silent film of the same name , herzog \\' s film is a work of exquisite bleakness , an oddly touching tragedy with a beautiful and uniquely haunting quality that lingers long afterwards . the original full - length english and german language versions of nosferatu have at last received a video release by u . s . distributor anchor bay entertainment , and in gorgeous widescreen prints . until now only a shortened english language version of the film was available on video , and only in europe . both of these re - releases restore the film to its full length , but viewers should still be wary of the english version due to its often stilted dialogue . apparently the english dialogue coach herzog had on the set during filming was incompetent , and some of the voices also seem to be dubbed . the german version with english subtitles remains the definitive one . everyone knows the story of dracula . or do they ? his story has been so bastardised on film over the years that a brief reminder of the basic plot certainly won \\' t hurt . jonathan harker is a young lawyer sent to the gloomy castle dracula in transylvania to do business with a creepy count ( played by klaus kinski ) who wants to buy a house in harker \\' s hometown . upon seeing a photo of harker \\' s wife ( the radiant isabelle adjani ) he instantly falls in love with her . locking harker up in his castle , he sets off on a long journey to meet this woman whose beauty so bewitches him . upon divining his identity as a vampire , adjani seduces the count and lures him to his death one morning as the sun rises . that is a story familiar to millions , but herzog has elevated stoker \\' s tale into the realm of - and i use this term a tad reluctantly - cinematic art . nosferatu is as much a meditation as it is a film , shot through blue - ish and white filters and peopled with characters who perform as if they were half hypnotised . the film \\' s surreal , dream - like quality is utterly mesmerising . there is much to enjoy , but i \\' ll limit my praise to a few key points . holding the film together is kinski \\' s remarkable performance as count dracula . past screen portrayals , including bela lugosi \\' s famous turn , have largely been one dimensional and tended towards camp . but kinski . . . oh boy , this is something far more compelling . aided by a startling make - up job , he portrays dracula \\' s vampirism not simply as pure evil but as some sort of loathsome disease . this man is dreadfully lonely . he lives in utter solitude , shunned by the locals for his hideous appearance and reputation for bloodlust . kinski \\' s portrayal of the count is both creepy and deeply affecting . when he dies , you almost feel as if this man \\' s tortured soul has been freed at last . then there \\' s the unforgettable soundtrack , largely composed by german group popul vuh . it is so eerily beautiful and evocative that it \\' s quite impossible to imagine the film without it . popul vuh are longtime herzog collaborators and play an ancient - sounding kind of spacemusic using piano , chants , and exotic instruments . when i first saw this film some years ago i was so impressed i tracked down and bought a number of their albums . the one i still listen to the most is \" tantric songs \" , from which most of the music in nosferatu is taken . it \\' s a testament to the music \\' s depth that it is as powerful without the pictures as it is with them . the album is still available on the highly respected ambient and world music label celestial harmonies . this is a timely re - release by anchor bay . after francis ford coppola \\' s unscary and woefully overblown version of bram stoker \\' s tale in 1992 , it is a joy to go back to herzog \\' s film and see the amazing things he has done with what is now a century - old story . to some aficionados , nosferatu is quite simply the greatest vampire film ever made . without a doubt , it is an unmistakable classic of the genre . don \\' t miss it .',\n",

       " ('a frequent error is the categorization of a terrorist as a soldier or a common criminal . a soldier commits acts of violence sanctioned by one nation - state against another . a common criminal commits acts of violence for personal gain . a terrorist employs random violence as a means to a political end . if the target nation does not affect the desired change in policy , the violence continues . it is the fear resulting from the fact that the terrorist may strike at anyone ( even total innocents ) , anywhere , at anytime that gives the figure his label . edward zwick \\' s the siege explores the possibility of this kind of violence taking place right here in the united states . you \\' d think the opening bit was ripped right from the headlines . arab terrorists kill american citizens abroad , and the u . s . responds by retaliating against the sheik whom supposedly ordered the attack . however , unlike the real - life tomahawk cruise missile strike against bin laden \\' s camp and manufacturing facility , the film version depicts special operations troops kidnapping sheik ahmed bin talal . in retaliation , the terrorists bring the fight to the new world . unwittingly involved is fbi assistant special agent - in - charge anthony hubbard ( denzel washington ) , who works out of the bureau \\' s new york office at one federal plaza . while investigating a series of bombings in the big apple , he encounters cia agent elise kraft ( annette bening ) , also trying to uncover information . generally , the fbi is charged with problems inside the u . s . , while the cia takes care of problems in the international realm . even spies from other countries are off limits to the cia as long as they are in our country . hubbard therefore finds it highly unusual that an agency spook is nosing around what he considers his territory , but as the two form a tentative professional relationship , hubbard becomes more and more aware of an increasingly complicated series of allegiances and possibly illegal actions involving terrorism and the united states government . the original tagline for patriot games was , \" there has never been a terrorist attack on american soil . \" however true , it was pulled before the movie \\' s release because it sounded too much like a dare . revisiting the scenario of foreign terrorists committing acts of violence in the united states , the siege is almost an invitation in itself , because it shows just what kind of turmoil could be produced if an effective terrorist network were to set up operations here in america . admittedly , the terror wrought upon new york is a bit excessive ( who \\' s going to believe that a few bombs are going to cause new yorkers to jump at the backfire of a bus or to curtail their shopping by two - thirds ? ) , but the basic premise is still valid . i liked the fact that this film rises above the basic action - thriller fare of good guy g - men against bad guy terrorists by exploring some of the effects on society and law and order . it provides a very possible hypothesis that violent activity on the part of a few arabs would escalate into a series of hate crimes against the arab - american population , and that in an effort to find the terrorists , the civil liberties of the minority may be violated by the government itself . in fact , about halfway through the film , when the president authorizes the declaration of martial law within new york city , the liberties of all americans are put at risk . although it may actually be a side effect of a terrorist campaign , the demise of social order in america is a scary thought and a goal which would not be beneath many international terrorist groups . throughout , the film maintains a conflict between hubbard , who wants to use the fbi to pursue the terrorists within the letter of the law , and general devereaux ( bruce willis ) , who is in command of the army and of the mind that the greater good would be better served by suspending the law and pursuing the terrorists more forcefully . what results is a fascinating debate over the appropriateness and constitutionality of the declaration of martial law and the invocation of the war powers act , utilizing philosophy and historical examples to make points on both sides . it actually gets rather heady at times , but it \\' s a credit to screenwriters zwick , lawrence wright , and menno meyjes that they don \\' t underestimate the intelligence of the audience . i don \\' t know if it \\' s his tone or inflection or something else , but denzel washington has a way of spitting out dialog that makes whatever he says sound great . this , combined with his innate acting ability and his experience in playing the mid - level authority figure , makes his performance in the siege convincing and enjoyable . annette bening gives one of the more assertive portrayals of a female character i \\' ve seen recently , and the chemistry she shares with washington is palpable . it \\' s somewhat unfortunate that her character \\' s fortitude is broken at a certain point , but it allows us to watch bening play a little more range . bruce willis is pretty much relegated to a tough - guy role , always standing straight , and with a permanent scowl fixed upon his face . however , the tension that exists between devereaux and hubbard is a major drive behind the film \\' s development . notable is tony shalhoub who plays fbi agent frank haddad , a lebanese immigrant . the role calls for evidencing both a kind of filial pride for his heritage , and contempt for those of his own race who might interfere with his integration into the american society . difficult to say the least , shalhoub does it with a naturalness you can almost reach out and touch . perhaps best known for his role as antonio the cab driver in the nbc sitcom \" wings , \" shalhoub gained notoriety for his dramatic abilities in the wonderful film big night . whereas denzel washington seems to be edward zwick \\' s favorite actor ( he directed washington in glory and courage under fire ) , james horner seems to be his favorite composer . i therefore found it odd that zwick chose the prolific score - writer graeme revell ( seven films this year already ) over horner for the siege until i realized that this film contained a lot of arabian - themed music , and horner \\' s record has shown more of a propensity for scores either neutral in ethnicity or irish - sounding at most . revell does a good job at providing appropriate music to punctuate key scenes and allowing the score to enhance the movie as a whole . it \\' s nowhere near as intrusive as in some of the other films we \\' ve been getting throughout the year . missteps in the siege can be found in a couple of the excesses it takes . for example , it \\' s pretty clear throughout that the film is meant to be more of thriller than an action flick . unfortunately , there \\' s a scene where the army just cuts loose against some arab immigrants in a blatant display of firepower and explosions , obviously meant for the sole purpose of being eye - catching . in the middle of the city ( and against no real opposition ) , zwick even has the army use a cobra attack helicopter to shoot rockets into a building no farther than 50 feet from friendly troops . verisimilitude really goes out the window at that point . the film also gets a little preachy toward the end , focusing on the ability of different races to get along . a noble gesture , the film just puts the message across a bit too obviously . these flaws are glaring , but they don \\' t detract too much from an otherwise good film that makes you think about issues you may not have considered since history class .',\n",

       " ('the film may be called mercury rising , but that title doesn \\' t describe the trajectory taken by this motion picture , a routine thriller that combines government cover - ups with a cloying and poorly - motivated buddy story . the \" hook \" that is supposed to make mercury rising unique is that the young protagonist is autistic . however , aside from giving actor miko hughes a chance to win raves for his performance , this particular aspect of the film comes across as nothing more than a convenient plot device . those expecting to see even a semi - thorough exploration of the condition will be disappointed . mercury rising treats autism with the same degree of efficiency that many action thrillers accord to alcoholism . the script for mercury rising is exceptionally tiresome and hard - to - swallow . i don \\' t know whether the problem is in the original book , simple simon , or in the screenplay adaptation , but this movie easily exceeds the intangible threshold beyond which a suspension of disbelief is no longer possible . once again , certain standby plot elements -- the high - level government conspiracy and the maverick law enforcement agent -- are recycled , and not to good effect . while bruce willis can play the action hero as well as anyone in hollywood , this particular outing leaves him marooned in situations that are characterized by too little tension and too much nonsense . the story begins with a formulaic sequence in which the tough fbi agent with a heart of gold , art jeffries ( bruce willis ) , is confronted with his own failure . unable to resolve a hostage crisis in time , he is forced to observe as two teenagers are shot to death . the event weighs heavily on his conscience and heavy - handedly establishes his motivation for protecting 9 - year old simon lynch ( miko hughes ) when he discovers the autistic child hiding in a closet after his parents have been gunned down by the evil hit man who looks like an ex - football player . soon , art and simon are on the run from seemingly everyone -- fleeing for their lives and bonding at the same time , with the evil hit man who looks like an ex - football player always just a step behind them . along the way , they are helped by the best friend who defies orders to help out his buddy ( chi mcbride ) and the supporting female who may or may not become a love interest ( kim dickens ) . why is simon in danger and why were his parents turned into swiss cheese by the evil hit man who looks like an ex - football player ? apparently , the government has spent millions of dollars developing an ultra - secret code called \" mercury . \" to make sure it can \\' t be cracked , they do the most intuitive thing possible : place a sample of it in a \" nerds \\' puzzle magazine . \" of course , no one can solve it -- no one except autistic simon , that is . when he calls the phone number listed in the solution , he gets the nsa . as a result , the cold - hearted , sneering government man ( alec baldwin ) decides that simon has to be eliminated -- for the good of the country , of course . but he hasn \\' t counted on the tough fbi agent with a heart of gold , even though everyone in the audience has . it \\' s hard to get worked up about a routine thriller that doesn \\' t do anything exceptionally well , and does quite a few things rather poorly . for those who are desperate to find elements of this movie to like , mercury rising manages to manufacture tension from time - to - time , but even the most exciting scenes ( such as the one where art and simon are crouched down , avoiding passing trains ) aren \\' t that pulse - pounding . the climactic struggle is a real ho - hum affair which leads to a finale that is painful in its obviousness . overall , director harold becker is constantly struggling ( and failing ) to generate even a moment that isn \\' t derivative or obligatory . bruce willis \\' star seems to be fading . this is his fourth straight lackluster outing , following last man standing , the fifth element , and the jackal . willis isn \\' t terrible , but this is the kind of role he can sleepwalk through , and often does . alec baldwin , combining elements of his characters from glengarry glenn ross and malice , does some scenery - chewing , but his performance is surprisingly lacking in menace . the film \\' s real star is young miko hughes ( heather langenkamp \\' s son in wes craven \\' s new nightmare ) , who does as good a job as dustin hoffman playing an autistic individual , but is about 50 years younger . mercury rising joins the likes of hard rain , the replacement killers , and u . s . marshals on the heap of pallid 1998 thrillers . for those who like action and adventure in the theater , this has not been a good year . hopefully , the advent of summer will change that . until then , the best choices ( for bruce willis or any other action hero ) are on video . and , if you \\' re determined to see mercury rising , check out the morning sky in early may .',\n",

why do helicopters have to follow godzilla by flying dangerously between buildings where they can lose sight of him , when they could more easily keep track of him by flying a little higher and in a straight line ? why do sidewinder missiles , which have small explosive warheads , blow up entire buildings when they miss godzilla ? why is a mission to bomb madison square garden carried out by three f - 18 fighter - bombers , when flights of such aircraft are always comprised of multiples of two ? okay , maybe the last one was a bit nit - picky , but hey , i was on a roll . broderick is usually a good actor , but in this film he \\' s weighed down by an unexciting character and an atrocious screenplay which seem to fight against him every step of the way . hank azaria does what he can , but don \\' t expect to see development of any of the promise he showed in the birdcage . like broderick \\' s , azaria \\' s character is quite simply lacking in color . what really annoyed me was maria pitillo , who actually takes the bad script and makes it worse with her acting . casting must have been asleep on this one . the one bright spot here is jean reno , who oddly enough seems to fit well into a role which is often comedic , quite unlike what we \\' ve seem him do in the past . although his character is contradictory to the unfolding disaster , reno brings a style to the role of phillipe which makes him enjoyable . unfortunately , the same cannot be said of the other incongruities . the entire feel of the movie is tongue - in - cheek , and seems to pay comical homage to a dozen or so films that have come before it . this results in a significant amount of parody , which contrasts sharply with the threat of the monster , and ends up just producing a mess . most of the characters seem to be there for comic relief , and almost none are smart enough for the audience to take seriously . although emmerich obviously wanted to make a fun action picture , what good is it to sink millions into a cgi creature whose ferocity is undermined by the humans he threatens ?

       " (\"near the end of 1996 , analysts remarked that the year would be the last in which disney would stand alone as the animation king . the following year , 1997 , saw the first sleeper entry into the genre from a studio other than the magic kingdom : twentieth century fox gave baronial russia to the masses in the form of anastasia . at best , that ' s all it was -- a sleeper hit , designed to surprise but not shake the industry . in 1998 , however , things have been decidedly different . there have been a number of pushes on disney ' s death grip on the market , and fifty - one weeks into ' 98 , a new champion has emerged . dreamworks ' the prince of egypt succeeds where all of the other conventionally animated products have failed . the other two contenders , warner brothers ' quest for camelot and disney ' s own annual entry , mulan , lacked inspiration and drive respectively . although camelot was borderline - abysmal , and can ' t really be considered a shot at the title , mulan had the makings of winner . unfortunately , it was saturated with traditional , disney - cute animation , and lost points against the rapidly - changing face of the competition . in making the prince of egypt , dreamworks has strayed from all of these hallmarks and created a genuinely unique product . the animation is flawless , and , aside from a bug ' s life , is the best - looking movie to date . the animators have nimbly mixed both flat and spatial effects , and the 2d / 3d combination is something that artists from disney and fox have heretofore struggled with . the key to success , however , was that the visuals were used not just because they looked cool but also as a method of advancing the plot . namely , some of the most important action sequences ( like the parting of the red sea ) were done almost entirely in 3d . dreamworks is the first studio to prove that they ' ve got the stuff of success , and that they ' re capable of challenging disney . the story is also well - written , and the characters voiced with talent . for the most part , the plot follows its source material -- the book of exodus -- although only in the most general sense . the writers took a few creative liberties , and most do not damage the story in any way . in fact , the shakespearean relationship between moses ( val kilmer ) and the pharaoh rameses ( ralph fiennes ) makes the story more interesting if anything . moses , a hebrew , is saved from the slaughter of the firstborn sons by his mother when she sets him in a basket on the nile ; he floats into the pharaoh seti ( patrick stewart ) ' s palace and is taken in by the royal family . moses grows up but learns of his heritage and flees into the desert , where he discovers the burning bush and is commissioned by god to return to egypt and free the slaves . by this time , rameses is now pharaoh , and the two brothers , now on opposite sides of the line , face off in a battle of wills and divine intervention . the cast of voices is most impressive , and also includes such noteables as sandra bullock , jeff goldblum , danny glover , and steve martin . the script does not have a lot of one - liners in it , and god is reduced to a voice that might well be mistaken for the same one that spoke to kevin costner in field of dreams , but overall the story is exciting and interesting . it ' s decidedly for an older crowd , and the tykes who haven ' t had a few years of religion class will be hopelessly lost . but for those who make the bid , the prince of egypt can be a great watch .\",\n",

       " ('you \\' ve got to think twice before you go see a movie with a title like maximum risk . the title is generic . it \\' s meaningless . and i can \\' t believe it \\' s good business . when you pick up the phone and dial 777 - film , how in the world are you supposed to remember that the new jean - claude van damme movie , the one that looked kind of cool in the trailers and is directed by some chinese hot shot , is called , geez , maximum risk ? yuck . the movie itself deserves your attention . for sweet bloody thrills , this one beats the summer blockbuster competition hands - down . only mission : impossible came close to delivering as skillful a thriller , and i \\' ll give maximum risk the edge simply because it \\' s not as slick as the tom cruise picture , and therefore more gratifying in its execution . much to my surprise , van damme continues to develop as a pleasant , unpretentious action hero . his track record isn \\' t as solid as schwarzenegger \\' s , but he \\' s a hell of a lot more adventurous than arnold . in 1993 , van damme worked with hong kong \\' s premier hardcore action director , john woo , on a fairly lame movie called hard target . ( if you can find a bootleg copy , woo \\' s radically different director \\' s cut is much better than what was eventually released . ) this follow - up is directed by ringo lam ( city on fire , full contact ) , whose hong kong films are distinguished action pictures that have consistently played second fiddle to woo \\' s more operatic offerings . the surprise here is that maximum risk is a more effective hollywood action flick than either hard target or woo \\' s subsequent broken arrow . here \\' s the rundown . van damme plays a french cop named alain moreau who is shaken when a policeman friend ( jean - hugues anglade ) finds a corpse that \\' s alain \\' s exact double . turns out alain was separated at birth from his twin brother , michael , who has been killed by some russian heavies ( and some strangely american looking cops ) . alain does some investigating . he finds that michael had booked a flight to new york city , and received a message from someone there named alex bohemia . assuming michael \\' s identity , alain flies to new york and gets tangled up with michael \\' s girlfriend ( natasha henstridge ) , the fbi , and the russian mob in little odessa . that \\' s as much as you need to know . the story is adequate , but not overly involving -- and the major plot points are basically explained to you twice , just in case you go out for popcorn at the wrong moment . there \\' s a love story , too , but i didn \\' t find it terribly convincing , partly because ex - model henstridge is too high - strung in her high - profile debut ( she had precious few lines as the alien ice queen in species ) . she \\' s great to look at , and she can certainly read a line , but what she does here can \\' t really be described as \" acting . \" of course , \" acting \" isn \\' t really what she was hired for ( i lost track of whether her shirt comes off more often than van damme \\' s ) . the movie is exceptionally violent , bordering on gratuity . ( keep that in mind when planning your date . ) the stunts are spectacular , and the fact that you can spot van damme \\' s stand - in makes his work no less impressive . there \\' s only so much you can do with a car wreck , but this movie makes crisp , effective use of pile - ups in a handful of frenzied destruction derbies . and lam has a surprising , innovative sense of exactly where the camera should go to catch any bit of action . the main difference between lam and woo , i believe , is that while woo relies on sheer spectacle to gas up his action show pieces , lam has figured out more about using cinematic space and double - barreled points of view to make things run . don \\' t get me wrong -- when chow yun - fat soars through space pumping bullets out of two pistols and chewing on a toothpick with glass and confetti littering the air around him in woo \\' s hard - boiled , it \\' s an amazing moment . but it \\' s a moment that \\' s hard to reproduce in hollywood . ( for one thing , hollywood doesn \\' t yet have chow yun - fat ! ) while woo \\' s hollywood movies look like the work of a talented upstart , maximum risk is a surprisingly confident picture . the very first shot of the film is an awkward overhead view of a chase through the streets of a european city , but lam \\' s use of odd camera angles becomes more efficient later on . the film editing is a particularly savvy complement to lam \\' s shooting style , accentuating rather than amplifying the action . the performances could have used some fine tuning ( in particular , there \\' s an annoying , overwritten manhattan cab driver in the early scenes who should have been toned down or jettisoned completely ) , and the movie doesn \\' t always overcome the limitations of its genre . the story is a little mundane , although there are some effective moments involving van damme \\' s unrequited feelings toward the brother he never knew he had . but it \\' s not often that hollywood cranks out a truly satisfying action picture , and it \\' s doubly surprising that this one should come with a mere whisper of publicity . van damme fans should treat themselves to what may well be the man \\' s best movie , and international action buffs will no doubt savor this flavorful hong kong / hollywood hybrid .',\n",

       " ('in \" the sweet hereafter , \" writer / director atom egoyan takes us beyond the tragedy of death into the tragedy of living . he shows us how it isn \\' t dying that hurts , but rather the pain of living in the hereafter of death , and dealing with the loss and grief that it brings . on a cold winter day in a small , isolated town in british columbia , a school bus full of children slides off the highway and onto a frozen lake , where it cracks through the ice and sinks . fourteen children die , and numerous others are hurt . for the residents of this small town , all of whose children were on that bus , it is an earth - shattering event that resolutely alters their lives . they have always relied on each other in the past to deal with heartache and pain , but it seems that this tragedy is more than they can handle . alberta and risa walker , who own a local motel and lost their child in the accident , hire an attorney named mitchell stephens ( ian holm ) to bring a lawsuit against someone , anyone for responsibility . the bus driver , dolores driscoll ( gabrielle rose ) , is a kindly woman who loved the children and , although she lives with a burden of guilt , is not held responsible for the accident . the bus seems to have simply slipped on some ice , and there was nothing should could do to prevent it . however , according to stephens , there are no \" accidents \" in life , and someone will pay for this tragedy , whether that be the manufacturer of the bus or the guardrail the bus broke through . he goes through the town , approaching the parents who have lost children , asking them to join the class action suit and find vent for their anger . and , for his work , stephens will receive one - third of the settlement money . however , it is immediately apparent that stephens has little or no interest in the money . he is driven by something else , something deeper that he shares in common with the grieving parents . he has lost a child , too , but not in the same manner . his daughter , zoe ( caerthan banks ) , who once almost died in his arms as a young child after a spider bite , has been in and out of drug re - hab clinics and detox stations for ten years . she calls him on an irregular basis , begging him for money , but refusing to tell him what she needs it for . \" i don \\' t know who i \\' m taking to , \" he tells her . in his mind , his daughter is dead . the lawsuit is , to stephens , not only a way to mend the town \\' s pain , but also his own . however , not everyone in town wants it to happen . billy ansell ( bruce greenwood ) , who was driving behind the bus when the accident happened and lost two children , wants nothing to do with it . he has already lost his wife , and he buries his grief in an affair with a married woman . he doesn \\' t want to talk about the accident , and he sees the lawsuit as nothing more than the unnecessary opening of old wounds . to him , the town should be able to take care of its own pain , and it doesn \\' t need outsiders like stephens getting in the way . central to \" the sweet hereafter \" is the tale of nicole burnell ( sarah polley ) , a teenage girl who dreams of being a singer before the accident turned her into \" a wheelchair girl , \" as she puts it . aside from stephens , nicole is the most complex character in the film , and it is she who ultimately decides the fate of the town and how the lawsuit will turn out . it is also her sad , haunted voice that we often hear on the soundtrack , reading robert browning \\' s poem about the pied piper , and how when he led all the town \\' s children away , one was left behind because he was crippled . obviously , nicole is that child , and she feels somehow betrayed that the rest of the town \\' s children left her alone by dying in the wreck . her situation is further complicated because she is involved in a loving , but incestuous relationship with her father ( tom mccamus ) . there is only one , fleeting scene that suggests this relationship , but it is somehow tied into the final act of the film . of all the storylines in \" the sweet hereafter , \" this is the most complicated and unresolved , although its implications stretch throughout the entirety of the film . egoyan knows that the kinds of questions he brings up have no simple answers -- if any at all -- and he doesn \\' t condescend to the audience by trying to neatly wrap it up . what egoyan has done in \" the sweet hereafter \" is really nothing short of miraculous . in his adaptation of the novel by russell banks , he has made a deeply moving film about a lawyer by transcending the pettiness of law and driving headlong into the deeper meaning of what is loss , and how pitiful monetary and material possessions are when compared to human life . egoyan has always been a talented , but distant and cerebral filmmaker whose work suffered only in that it felt so cold . \" the sweet hereafter \" is quite the opposite ; egoyan \\' s stylistic and narrative structures work brilliantly to heighten the impact of the natural emotion , and draw the audience into the tragedy . \" the sweet hereafter \" seems to contain the combined emotional impact that all his other films lacked . the film is filled with beautiful , subtle performances from all the actors , especially ian holm as the lawyer and sarah polley as the sad child who was left behind . the beautiful , roving camerawork by paul sarossy and the haunting , melodic musical score by mychael danna ( both previous egoyan collaborators ) give the film a visual and aural cohesiveness with the thematic elements . like his earlier films , egoyan weaves together multiple storylines that form a blanketing whole . he works with time as a fluid substance , shifting back and forth between the past , the distant past , and the present with effortless ease . the actual bus wreck itself doesn \\' t happen until midway through the film , but by that time the event has built up so much emotion that egoyan can film it from a distance with no graphic detail , and still have it carry great , devastating weight . because human life has become such a cheap commodity in movies , it is astounding that egoyan can convey so much heartbreak in such simple , direct terms . certainly one of the best films of 1997 , \" the sweet hereafter \" is a deeply rewarding , mystifying , and ultimately human film .',\n",

so far america has been the leading nation , opposing the fundamentalist terrorists around the world . it is the land of opportunities . it is the land of freedom . but what if it became the new target ? this dark fantasy has unfortunately a very strong grounding in reality . when a special branch of the united states military , under the command of general william devereaux ( bruce willis ) , takes prisoner suspected terrorist mastermind sheik ahmed bin talal , islamic fundamentalists across the world take notice . the only warning the fbi receives is a single , cryptic message : \" release him . \" then all hell breaks loose in new york . a bus is destroyed , killing 25 civilians . a broadway theater is bombed . hostages are taken at a school . as the wave of terrorist activity crests , the president must consider if the only way to save the city and break the grip of fear is to declare martial law . devereaux argues against that eventuality , but is nevertheless ready to lead 10 , 000 men into action on american soil . another person not in favor of martial law is anthony hubbard ( denzel washington ) , the fbi agent in charge of investigating the terrorist activities . his staff is comprised of smart , energetic , intelligent men and women very much unlike the usual group o ! f moronic feds we \\' re used to seeing in movies . hubbard develops an uneasy alliance with cia agent elise kraft ( annette bening ) , whose department knows more about the situation than they \\' re willing to reveal . but the attacks escalate . the fbi are helpless , chasing an invisible enemy . the land is under siege . they have lost control . . a terror is coming from within . . what \\' s great about this film is that it is made as if holding up a mirror to life . it reflects reality . and that \\' s why it makes such an impact . edward zwick has created a clever , well written and terrifying thriller that may very well be one of the best films of the season . the director manages to tell several stories simultaneously . and so his film plays on several levels , never loosing focus on its main objective . he is exploring the abuse of power , the distrustful relationships that exist between various segments of the u . s . government ( the army , the fbi , and the cia ) . he takes a look at the complexities inherent when so many secrets and lies are involved . the palestinian community in 1998 new york is treated exactly as japanese americans were during world war ii . there are concentration camps and unlawful interments , all in the name of the \" greater good . \" in the latter part of the film the land of opportunities looses its heart and soul -- freedom . was that what the terror ! ists really wanted ? this film has evoked protests and objections from the arab - american population in the u . s . and n . y . especially . but to me these protests seem unnecessary . zwick is careful to not step over the line and make the palestinians typical hollywood bad guys . the script is therefore wonderfully balanced . agent hubbard \\' s best friend and loyal colleague frank haddad ( tony shalhoub ) is lebanese - american . and it is quite often you hear lines such as \" my first boyfriend was palestinian . they seduce you with their suffering \" or \" they love this country as much as we do . \" but no matter how you twist this matter , you won \\' t get away from the fact that when it comes to world wide terrorism it is arab - speaking population who are in the great majority . more to the point , the siege demonstrates the injustice of blanket condemnation of any ethnic group by depicting the unfair treatment of all arab - americans by the u . s . military . and thus this film does not serve as a source for discrimination in any ! way . denzel washington is dashing as always . in this role he is much more determined and stronger than usual . anette bening is enjoyable and believable as a shadowy cia operative who prefers espionage , a network of snitches and seduction to gather information . . bruce willis is terrifying as the sadist , hungry for power , that never looses his connection with the audience , since his point of view is not too hard to understand . the film is elegantly shaped . the scenes are easily floating into each other and the film never seems overlong . zwick knows exactly how to provoke tension , horror and emotions and does it with a rarely observed professionalism . he tightens the intensity as the events progress . and when a plot twist comes , it actually is surprising . it is not a film drained in patriotism , like the work of roland emerich . nor is it a film that portrays explosions purely for entertainment values . it is a daring picture that has courage enough to undertake such a risky story and difficult journey . it has courage enough to get involved in politics . it questions our foreign policies , mentality and defense . i must admit that it ends rather disappointing , as the director turns the patriotism way up and innovation down . but despite of that , it is certainly an intelligent and thrilling film that provokes emotions and thoughts ; a virtue that few summer films can boast of . \" this is the u . s . army . it \\' s a broadsword , not a scalpel . believe me , you do not want us in an american city \" - gen . william devereaux , \" the siege \"',\n",

       " ('uncompromising french director robert bresson \\' s \" lancelot of the lake \" achieves the exact opposite effect of sir thomas malory \\' s \" morte darthur . \" instead of enshrining the legend of king arthur and his knights of the round table , it dethrones them by revealing arthur as a weak , ineffectual leader and the knights as a group of jealous , bickering men who failed to live up to the legends prescribed to them . chivalry has no place in \" lancelot of the lake , \" except as that of a dying ideal . bresson begins his tale as the knights of the round table are returning , decimated , after failing merlin \\' s command to retrieve the holy grail , the mystical cup that was filled with christ \\' s blood . bresson immediately gives us his impression of the essential meaning of the grail quest : bloodshed and failure . the opening sequence is a series of clumsy , disjointed fights amongst anonymous knights -- a head is hacked off , a stomach is impaled , a skull is split open , skeletal remains hang from trees , and burning bodies smolder in the ruins of a flaming house . since the film starts with camelot in near - ruin , and takes only an hour and a half to arrive at its inevitable conclusion , it doesn \\' t carry the grand , tragic resonance of other arthurian films . we never get to see camelot at the peak of its power , therefore there is no real downfall to witness . but , then again , it is not the name of camelot that is evoked in the title of the film . rather , it is lancelot , and bresson is more interested in the internal battle within his heart , than the external downfall of a kingdom . lancelot has always been a tragic figure in the arthurian tales , and bresson uses him as the central figure to explore the battle between the spirit and the flesh . the greatest of all knights , he was flawed only in his love for arthur \\' s wife , queen guinevere , and it was that illicit affair that eventually caused the downfall of camelot . even when lancelot attempts to end the affair with guinevere ( laura duke condominas ) , he only finds himself falling back into her arms against his better judgment . he knows it means the destruction of the idealized kingdom , but he is powerless in his passion . when sir mordred ( patrick bernhard ) accuses lancelot of the affair , other knights , including sir gawain ( humbert balsan ) spring to lancelot \\' s defense . it is this battle within the knights that is the eventual undoing of the round table ; the flesh wins out over the spirit , and the consequences are dire . bresson is an intensely personal filmmaker most interested in the interiors of men \\' s hearts and minds . \" lancelot of the lake \" is filled with his particular trademarks : a stripped - down , minimalist style , flat , expressionless dialogue , and a grand use of natural sounds in place of music . he uses background music only twice in the film , during an opening narration segment and during the opening credits . the music here is a heavy drumbeat and accompanying bagpipes , but the rest of the film is scored with natural sounds that punctuate the film \\' s thematic elements : the incessant clanking and creaking of heavy armor , the neighing of horses , the rhythm of hooves beating down dirt roads , and the natural chirping and whispering of the forest . like most of his other films , bresson employed nonprofessional actors who recite the dialogue in emotionless , flat voices . all the actors he used in \" lancelot of the lake \" had never acted before , and with the exception of patrick bernhard , they never acted again . never once do they raise their voices or put any emphasis on a given word . instead of using vocal inflection , bresson strove to create emotion through images . in some ways , this technique works ; in other ways , it doesn \\' t . the final montage of arthur \\' s men battling each other is quite marvelous , and the final image of the knights in shining armor reduced to a literal scrap - pile sums up the entire film in one moment . however , other times bresson \\' s uncompromising methods are distracting and questionable . for instance , during an important jousting contest , bresson films the majority of the action so that the only things visible are the horses \\' legs . he does this repeatedly , opening each shot with the same few notes from a bagpipe and the raising of a different flag . while there might be symbolic value in this , the resulting experience of watching it can be bothersome . nevertheless , \" lancelot of the lake \" is a fascinating cinematic experience boldly made by a master filmmaker . bresson \\' s style may not be for everyone , but one has to respect his strength as an artist . by re - evaluating the arthurian legends and making them his own , he turns \" lancelot of the lake \" into something rare in modern cinema : a truly personal film .',\n",

       " ('note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . be forewarned . i was incredulous when i first heard that mgm was planning a sequel to their 1995 science - fiction flick species . squandering an intriguing premise , the original film turned out to be a dreadful mess , widely disliked by both audiences and critics alike -- and nonetheless still somehow succeeded in becoming a financial success , raking in over $ 60 million domestic during the competitive summer season despite a distinct lack of star power in its cast ( ben kingsley \\' s a splendid actor , but a marquee name he ain \\' t ) . miraculously dodging the bullet with the first film , i doubted that they \\' d dare tempt fate and go for another round . so here comes species ii , with a new creative team ( director peter medak and screenwriter chris brancato step in for roger donaldson and dennis feldman , respectively ) that fails to improve the series one iota -- like its predecessor , species ii fails to capitalize on a potentially promising kernel and instead runs the gamut from ridiculously silly to unmitigatedly stupid . the film follows the exploits of a young man , patrick ross ( justin lazard ) , whose sole focus is on cruising along the streets in order to pick up women , loitering in strip clubs , and generally trying to bed as many different ladies as he possibly can . in other words , patrick is like a lot of guys ; these activities could describe the everyday routines of a huge percentage of men his age , but there \\' s a catch -- he \\' s an astronaut who recently returned from a seemingly successful mission to mars , and who \\' s now infected with alien dna . patrick \\' s overriding compulsion : to mate and sire countless numbers of gooey little alien offspring . and when he becomes aware of eve ( natasha henstridge ) , a half - human , half - alien clone of the monster from the first film being studied in a government lab , patrick \\' s primary focus turns to her -- \" if these two were to mate , the resulting pure strain of offspring would be unstoppable \" warns dr . laura baker ( marg helgenberger , gamely reprising her role ) with admirable conviction . species ii opens with the mars mission , and the space scenes are remarkably unconvincing and hokey - looking , even splicing back to dated , grainy footage of actual spacecraft activities -- they really skimped on production values this time around . however , this all looks positively inspired when compared to the first appearance of the evil alien goo which ultimately infests patrick ; watching as it slinks around the command module of the spaceship , any question as to whether or not this is a cheesy b - movie is quickly answered . mr . brancato \\' s original screenplay is filled with outrageous lines which often leaves the audience in stitches . like the first film ( and perhaps in homage to it ) , there \\' s a real penchant for dialogue which underlines the obvious . last time around featured the hootworthy line uttered by forest whitaker \\' s psychic empath character upon entering a bloodsoaked room -- \" something bad happened here . \" this time , laura gets to stand over a fresh , shredded corpse with its entails ripped out and mutter \" this is awful . \" and she \\' s not even empathic ! and when a psychotically horny patrick accosts a supermarket shopper and drags her kicking and screaming behind the building in a woefully - paced suspense sequence , eve , who \\' s telepathically linked to her alien / human - hybrid counterpart ( whatever ) , helpfully tells our alien - hunting protagonists , \" he \\' s going to rape her . \" while species ii is often unintentionally hilarious , at least it occasionally demonstrates a sense of humour of its own . there \\' s an amusing , tongue - in - cheek bit of product placement ( which doesn \\' t really make much sense , but i appreciated the sentiment ) , as well as some supermarket - related hijinx ( \" he \\' s in aisle 1 ! \" informs eve ) . if the film maintained this sort of light - hearted tone , it would have been much more charming and enjoyable to watch , but , to its detriment , it instead takes its silly plot far too seriously and barrels along to a bloody , effects - ladened anticlimactic conclusion . much of the film fails to make a whole lot of sense , and there are such gaping plot holes that it \\' s terribly difficult to contain any suspension of disbelief . the implausibilities are endless : what about the toxic bomb in eve \\' s brain ? why are the guards armed with guns when they already know firearms are ineffectual ? my favourite was the slow - motion sequence in the film where eve , sporting superhuman strength , is shown tossing aside guards who are attempting to contain her with what look like body blocks . this is the sort of movie which leaves you holding your head in amazed disbelief , incredulous that it \\' s being foisted upon the public . returning headlines michael madsen ( who reprises tough guy press lennox ) and ms . helgenberger do what they can with this goofy screenplay , but there \\' s realistically only so much one can do with this script as a basis . mykelti williamson ( portraying astronaut dennis gamble ) churns out an all - too - familiar spin on a generic brash - mouthed character , and fine character actors george dzundza ( playing colonel burgess and looking ridiculous in the process ) and james cromwell ( patrick \\' s neglectful father , senator ross ) are utterly wasted in the film . mr . lazard gives his character an appropriately shifty - eyed look , while returning vixen ms . henstridge is actually given the opportunity to act in one scene ( and acquits herself nicely ) , but is mostly relegated to reprising her familiar role of parading about in skimpy clothing ( or none at all ) . ms . henstridge recently commented on how some female audiences have expressed appreciation for her character in the first entry of the species series , claiming that \" she \\' s so empowered . \" a lethal half - alien in heat who dispatches of her sexual partners in grotesque fashion -- now * that \\' s * what i call empowerment .',\n",

( smart was convicted and given a life sentence for her part in the murder of her husband . ) smart \\' s got a point . it wouldn \\' t be the first time that the public took the better scripted and well - acted movie version of an event as the absolute truth over the duller and far less artistic real life version . however , given a choice between the mass media \\' happening \\' of the real event and the fictionalized movie , i would definitely opt for the later . real murderers rarely have dialogue as witty as what buck henry has written for this movie and smart , while pretty and alluring , is no match for the cinematic charms of nicole kidman . to die for begins in a town called little hope , new hampshire , the archetypal dry and intellectually barren american suburb . the story concerns the ambitious suzanne stone and how she tackles the obstacles between her and her life long ambition of being \\' on tv . \\' of course , one of those little obstacles turns out to be her dull and unambitious husband larry , played by matt dillon . but , with a little imagination , some charm and raw sex appeal and a rather novel approach to junior achievement , our heroine manages to overcome the nay - sayers in her life , at least temporarily . kidman triumphs in the trashy role of suzanne . i have never really been all that fond of this actress but she shows a wonderful flair for comedy in this picture . her portrayal of the incredibly shallow and dumb femme fatale resonates . kidman knows a star - making role when she sees it and she plays the conscience - deprived suzanne as the ultimate career driven , post - feminist uber - temptress from hell . she is ably abetted by wonderfully demented comic dialogue , which kidman delivers in a unselfconsciously funny way . at one point suzanne is expounding on her knowledge of world events to her future husband and sister - in - law . \" you know , \" she knowingly exclaims , \" gorbachev would still be the leader of russia or whatever , if he had just had that ugly purplish thing removed from his head . \" her husband beams at suzanne \\' s profound knowledge of world politics and then proudly proclaims that this qualifies her to be the next barbara walters . this is very close to pop culture bashing heaven , folks . the other standout performance in the film is delivered by joaquin phoenix . he plays jimmy , a burned out teenager who becomes addicted to suzanne \\' s sexual favors . kidman \\' s character , vapid though she is , is a sort of suave beacon of success to jimmy and his lost friends russell and lydia , winningly portrayed by casey affleck and alison folland . phoenix looks like the very embodiment of gen - x slackerhood ( as envisioned by tabloid tv , of course ) . his jimmy has the dead eyes and demeanor of a kid who knows that he ain \\' t going anywhere , ever . phoenix reacts to the sexy suzanne with a sort of obsessed amazement and he makes us believe that a loser character like jimmy really would be willing to kill for someone like suzanne , someone who actually noticed him . gus van sant ( drugstore cowboy , my own private idaho ) direction is first - rate . he keeps the pacing in this not - quite - thriller snapping along . van sant rightly keeps the focus of this movie on the amoral suzanne and doesn \\' t stop to proselytize the audience about the rightness or wrongness of her actions . van sant trusts his material and trusts his audience to \\' get it \\' without stopping to explain what is funny about this all - american story . the screenplay , by buck henry , is absolutely great and includes some of the best bleakly comic lines i \\' ve heard since heathers . henry \\' s story is a blast against the shallowness of the american media and the mindlessness of fame , yet the screenplay delivers this sharp message by focusing on just a few characters . henry ably manages to avoid diluting his story by aiming at too many targets and the result is a crisp and funny mini - classic . danny elfman did the original music for this movie and he delivers another eccentric , loopy score that strongly echoes his themes for edward scissorhands . either film score would make wonderful background music for halloween trick - or - treat parties . all - in - all , a wonderful production , well worth your seven bucks ! to die for : a columbia pictures release directed by gus van sant . written by buck henry score by danny elfman starring nicole kidman , matt dillon , joachin phoenix based on the book by joyce maynard . rated r - for language and mature themes .

       " ('the 1998 summer movie season is still in its infancy . but after diasappointing films such as \" godzilla \" and \" fear and loathing in las vegas \" , it would be nice to see a really good film . but i doubt you could have expected this . the truman show is one of the most unique films i have ever seen , and it deserves a spot on the \" decade \\' s best \" list . there is no way to isolate any single component of this picture and proclaim , \" yes , that \\' s what makes this film great . \" the blend of peter weir \\' s masterful ( and in many ways brilliant ) direction , peter biziou \\' s stunning photography and jim carrey \\' s performance is what makes this film work so fantastically . there is something strangely beautiful about every shot in the truman show . it may be the use of color or the placement of characters in the frame , but everything about this film looks intentional and perfect . carrey has made a very wise choice . by playing mild - mannered truman burbank , he allows himself enough room to be comical , and therefore not alienating his true fans , while still showing a vulnerable and human side . that is a side which has been missing from nearly every major character he has played in his numerous commercial successes . truman burbank was born to an audience of millions . he was chosen before birth to be the focus of a 24 hour television show . everything in his environment is controlled by a team of technicians , led by the show \\' s director , christof ( played by ed harris ) . everyone in truman \\' s life is an actor or an extra . they are all being watched by millions of people around the globe , people who can tune in at any time of the day to see what is happening in truman \\' s life . but he is the only person that is not aware of it . the classification of the truman show may be tricky . the audience reacted to many of truman \\' s revelations with laughter . i did not laugh much during the film because i was so emotionally wrapped up with the character . the things that made the audience laugh gave me glassy eyes , because what was happening to him , indeed what had been done to him his whole life was wrong . so is this going to end up labeled as a comedy ? a drama ? it really depends on the audience . but to me , the truman show was a touching , sad tale about the extents to which a corporation will go to exploit human life for the entertainment of others . but above all else , the truman show was a stunningly beautiful picture with humor , heart and scary realism . oscar predictions in june are pointless , but if the truman show had been released on schedule in late fall or winter of 1997 , as originally planned , james cameron would be oscar - less .',\n",

       " (\"vampires starts out almost in the style of a spaghetti western with an attack on a small homestead in new mexico . the house has a nest of vampires and jack crow ( james woods ) is leading a team of vampire hunters in to clean them out . while the initial imagery is a little over - dramatic , it gives way to what is a fairly decent action sequence . that is enough action to last us a while and we could , director john carpenter would let us , get to a story line . but it is not very long and there is not much plot until the next big action scene . then there is only a bit more of plot before the next action scene after that . the plot is kept to a minimum and the interesting ideas in the plot really get the short end . and that is something of a pity because the film , based on the book vampire $ by john steakley , gives us a myth for the origins of vampires and explains why vampires are so intertwined with religious imagery . this could be an interesting departure from the standard vampire film , but carpenter decides to tell us about it rather than to show it . what carpenter saves his serious screen time for a sequence of spectacular fights between hunters and vampires . there is a lot of fighting and lots of gore . anything intriguing is kept to a minimum to so it does not get in the way of pleasing the action film fans . this has not always been carpenter ' s style . his 1981 version of the thing has action but also challenges the viewer to do a little thinking about the film ' s central science fictional question . jack crow heads a vampire swat team , cleaning up nests of vampires with high - tech spears and crossbows . in the early part of the film his team is wiped out by a particularly mean vampire valek ( thomas ian griffith ) who has been tipped off to who crow is . now crow team is gone and he is down to himself and his sidekick tony montoya ( daniel baldwin ) . to make matters worse , he does not know the people on his own side , tony and his backers , he can trust . meanwhile jack is sure the vampires are looking for something that must be hidden somewhere here in new mexico . if this is sounding like a very tired police corruption plot with a few obvious substitutions , that ' s exactly what it is . the same story looks just as well with two partner cops looking for a gang of hood who are themselves looking for a packet of heroin . but carpenter goes against a familiar principle of film : show people , don ' t tell them . just about everything in the plot other than the fights we are told about in the dialog and not shown . fundamental questions in the plot like where does crow get his funding , why are the vampires in new mexico -- what do they want and why do they want it , what is the connection of the vampires and the catholic church , how did crow come to be a vampire hunter and why devote his life to it ? the answers to any of these questions could have been dramatized , but instead are revealed through dialog . now if all this was not bad enough , carpenter misuses the james wood persona . woods plays a particular sort of cool lowlife very well . but carpenter leads off the film by having woods do some sergio - leone - style mythic posturing . while his crew prepares for an attack he stands staring fixedly through shades at the house that will be his target . woods does not work as a larger than life mythic hero . that is not his style and it just does not work very well . there are some simple things that carpenter should be looking for as director that he misses . in one scene we are looking at a motel room with dead people on the floor . one female corpse is on the floor in front of a chair so that there is about an inch of daylight between her and the chair . as the actress breathes the gap widening and narrowing makes it obvious her arm is moving up and down . one also wonders how the existence of vampires is kept secret . these vampires do not maintain a low profile . there are arguably logical flaws in the film . there is some question in my mind whether carpenter has a consistent policy on what effect bullets have on vampires . it would take some rationalization to explain why in some scenes sunlight has a dramatic effect on vampires , yet in a scene toward the end a vampire can walk under a burned roof that lets him be swept by beams of sunlight . i suspect that the book on which this film was based was better thought out . while i might recommend this film to an action audience i would say that what i look for in a vampire film vampires rates a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the - 4 to + 4 scale . perhaps i will read the book .\",\n",

       " ('this has some major spoilers for the film , so be forwarned . the won \\' t appear till later in the article , so you \\' re safe for now . eyes wide shot ( 1999 ) running time : 2 hours 39 minutes 2 . 35 : 1 theatrical aspect starring : tom cruise ( dr . bill hardford ) , nicole kidman ( alice hardford ) , sidney pollack , leelee sobieski , todd field ( nick nightingale ) directed , co - written , produced by : stanley kubrick inspired by : \" traumnovelle \" by : arthur schnitzer this is an interesting film . i must first off state , that you musn \\' t believe any of the rumors of the film . cruise is not a cross dresser , kidman doesn \\' t shoot heroin , and there \\' s not any scene between the two that would suggest that they were aided by a sex therapist . the look of the film is to suggest that it follows the translation of the inspired book from the film was written . the translation , \" dream novel , \" makes you thing that the film should have been titled dream film . there is a noticable amount of graininess to the film . rather than complain about it as some may and already have , see it as a style of shooting . i would gather that kubrick got on another lighting kick shooting this and shot with as much natural light as he could . this and the film looks like it was pushed another two stops to add more grain and brighten it slightly . as an auteur and stickler for details , kubrick seemed to be a bit lax on this one . the film looks great , but there are a good deal of bloopers / flubs that occur . you see lots of boom shots ( in reflection ) and you see the camera at least twice . 16 months for this ? wow . reflection is the biggest killer for this film . their apartment and almost everything in the film casts reflections and the crew can be seen in these , some quite glaringly . one more topic of heated discussion : i saw the \" austin powers \" version , and to be perfectly frank , unless you know where the overlays are supposed to be , you \\' ll probably not see them . two girls standing next to each other look a little suspicious , but i can wait for the unrated version on video to see it the way it \\' s supposed to be . spoilers below : the film itself starts with ( cruise ) bill and ( kidman ) alice getting ready for a little x - mas soiree . they go to a quite elegant party in what seems to be a storagehouse for lighting equipment , which is actually an apartment owned by pollack . bill runs into an old friend from medical school who is now the party \\' s entertainment . soon after , bill and alice are flirting with others at the party , thinking that the other has not noticed . bill is called to help with a partygoer who has had a bit too much of a good time . the next day , bill and alice , casually smoking marijunana in their bedroom discuss the previous nights flirtations . they both discover that they both knew about the flirting . bill starts talking about what women can provide in a relationship , and gets alice extremely angry . in her hazy state , she tells of an opportunity she almost acted on to cheat on bill , not caring about the possible aftereffects . bill gets called away when one of his patients dies , and goes to console his daughter . when his patient \\' s engaged daughter makes a plea for his love and affection , he is struck with images of an affair that never occured between his wife , alice and a naval officer . he sees \" opportunity \" as a betrayal to his wife , and before they can continue , they are interrupted . as he strolls home , he encounters a hooker . seeing another \" opportunity \" arise , he follows the hooker home . they toy around , but before the act ensues , alice calls his cell phone . he breaks the date with the hooker , and heads back out into the night . he passes a lounge and notices that his old medical school buddy is playing , so he heads in . when he meets the friend , the friend reveals that for extra scratch , he plays these strange parties , while blindfolded . bill is intrigued and wants to go to one . nick reluctantly sets him up with directions and a password . what follows this is a short meeting where bill obtains a costume for this party and meets a young girl , leelee sobieski , and her father . the young girl has drawn his eye , but her young age , and the prescence of her father deter this from happening . he gets to the party , which is to say the least , a strange affair . after partaking in some strange \" religious \" right , women and men pair off for the orgy to end all orgies . a woman warns bill in disguise , that he should leave before he is exposed as a fraud at the party . he is detained after a second warning , where he is outed for not being in the group . after getting home , he hides the evidence of his evenings events . unable to carry on in his day , he tries piece the events of the previous night together . in the process , he finds that nick has disappeared , his life is possibly in danger , and the woman that warned him has died . i \\' m trying to save a bit of the film here , it \\' s worth sitting through to get to this point . this is only about 100 minutes at this point . this is a strange film , because despite the events that occur , the film has a strong family message behind it . it will be hard to pidgeonhole this film as a certain kind of a film . it \\' s got sex in it , it has nudity , drugs , and many more immoralistic values . but they all serve to show why they are bad in one \\' s life . i recommend this film highly on many merits . cruise and kidman are rarely together for longer than 5 minutes after the opening scene , and the secrecy that shrouded the film should hopefully be apparent as to why it was kept once you see it for yourself .',\n",

       " (\"the word ' rest ' in the title should be stressed since this is a movie that lacks any action scenes at all . what does takes place is more based on character development . the film starts right in the middle of the lives of four people : nick , beth , carol and sid . what they have done earlier is for the most part only hinted at . nick and beth have a relationship and have decided to move from enfield , arizona to butte , montana . ( and i who thought that butte was pronounced slightly different . . . ) carol is nick ' s ex - girlfriend and beth ' s best friend , sid is a joint - smoking painter that comes to repaint their house before the new tenants move in . obviously based on a stage play , the problem with the movie is that there ' s a lot of things left out . it ' s not obvious that nick and beth are in love with each other , the reason why nick was fired from his job isn ' t mentioned . and why nick suddenly decide to go visit his parents remain a mystery , when he hasn ' t seen them for many years . set in a small ( fictional ? ) town in arizona was a good move , since this makes the film focus on the four characters and not on their surroundings . the name of the city is not important , this could take place anywhere with four young people in a house discussing life and the future . particularly impressive is bridget fonda as beth who end up in bed with sid when her fiance nick leaves her . not an actress that i have found interesting earlier or seen many pictures with , but i ' ll keep an eye on her in the future . interesting trivia : this was rated r in the us but rated ' barntill ? ten ' in sweden wich means that anyone at any age can see it .\",\n",

       " ('writers : dennis feldman and jonathan hensleigh ( based on the comic book by chuck pfarrer ) starring : jamie lee curtis , william baldwin , donald sutherland , joanna pacula , sherman augustus , marshall bell , cliff curtis , julio oscar mechoso i suppose i \\' m not extremely surprised that \" virus \" comes to us from a deciple of james cameron ( john bruno ) , and if i strain real hard , i could even say that it \\' s an obvious given , particuarly looking from the standpoint of mr . cameron \\' s early works . in fact , \" virus \" is yet another in the long line of action / horror / paranoia thrillers from the \" aliens \" vein : a group of people are dropped into a mysterious situation only to find a mortally - threatening entity is out to get them , a textbook example hailing all the way back to the early talkies , and maybe even to the first pictures , albeit redeveloped by cameron in his 1986 blockbuster that earned him esteem and bigger budgets to come in his future . no such thing will happen to bruno , whom i believe worked in some capacity on that quasi - landmark feature ; while bruno may have studied under cameron \\' s wing for years and years , i \\' m beginning to wonder at what capacity , and what exactly did he learn from him . in fact , \" virus \" should at least be mediocre ; the fact that bruno could have worked under a man like cameron - a director who , if anything , just knows how to make a movie - and then make a film like \" virus \" is just another detraction fairly aimed at this z - grade schlockfest of a film , albeit a z - grade schlockfest with a respectable budget . the film seems to not only borrow it \\' s plot from last year \\' s similarly - fated \" deep rising , \" but also from a clunkish b - movie from the \\' 80s called \" leviathan , \" an underwater thriller starring peter weller , richard crenna , hector elizando , and daniel stern about a group of miners who stumble upon an alien lifeform that was part \" alien , \" part john carpenter \\' s twisted remake of \" the thing . \" \" virus , \" again , has a similar , uh , selling point : a group of sailors on a boat stumble upon a russian cruiser that is dead in the water . they get on . they break up into pairs and investigate . and they find an alien lifeform on board that comes in the form of energy , has taken over all the machines on board , have meshed the machines with parts from corpses , and have deemed humankind their enemy because of a misquote in the dictionary ( ha ha ) . not that any of this is for a second scary or the least bit involving ; not only does this film start off with a chintzy bond - ian opening ( the destruction of the cruiser via a satellite transmission from mir ) , destroying any of the suspense in what could happen , but it also fails to bring us any interesting chracters . of its motley crew , it only choses as its potentially eccentric cast of characters a lead woman skipper , a masculine potential - romantic - interest , a drunken captain , a black technician , a tatooed aborigine , a manic russian survivor , and a couple other candidates for alien food , none whom are the least bit interesting or more dimensional than a thin , plain piece of writing paper . and it \\' s not the traditional argument for films like these , where you may in fact want them all to be eaten ( even \" aliens \" played with the karma of the arrogant soldiers , but this was more of a plus - side for the film as a whole than the opposite ) ; instead , as another cliche goes , you just don \\' t give a damn . i almost don \\' t even have to say that the acting from everyone ranges from sub - par to horrific , the former being jamie lee curtis in the lead showing off what a strong female lead she is ( and she is , just not really here ) and the latter being - and it pains me to say this as he \\' s a particular favorite of mine - donald sutherland , who plays the captain so poorly and without a second of credibility that this will go down as the performance - of - which - he - should - be - ashamed . like anthony hopkins for \" legends of the fall \" ( the line \" scrooooooo \\' em \" has been thus embroidered upon my membrance ) . or peter o \\' toole in \" caligula . \" great actor , horrific performance . it happens every now and then , and it only helps sutherland \\' s career that no one , except for an elite few , even bothered to see this film . though it has sat on the shelves of universal studios for about two years , waiting until it can be released and make as much money as it possibly can ( read : early january , when everyone \\' s still trying to catch up on the potential oscar - nominees ) , it does show that universal shelled out a pretty penny to make this film : it \\' s laden with complex machinery , boasts respectable production design , and it may even feature believable special effects . . . if , of course , i , or anyone else , could see them . \" virus \" mostly takes place on a large , abandoned cruiser , and mostly at night until the dawn , and mostly without the use of lights , not so much for the productivity of the alien creatures in their pursuit of their human prey , but more so because , as the hollywood cliche seems to go , \" if it \\' s dark enough , then the special effects will be more believable . \" and if you don \\' t believe me , go back and rent \" godzilla , \" and tell me if there \\' s even one shot where we see godzilla either a ) in his entirety in one wide shot , or b ) n the light so that we can at least see him ( well , you don \\' t really have to sit through it again ;

       " (\"note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . be forewarned . to assess alex cox ' s film the winner as a loser would be so indolent . it would be derisive . it would be glib . it would be dismissive . it would be entirely accurate . rarely have i seen a film as excruciatingly annoying as the winner , a would - be comedy which quickly proves to be tedious , unfunny , and unengaging . the film attempts to be fresh and quirky , utilising a myriad of colourful characters to weave its absurd tale , but appears to overlook the fact that nobody in the film is remotely interesting and that all of the characters are essentially preposterous . the film is set in las vegas , and the focus in the winner is on philip ( vincent d ' onofrio ) , an aloof , naive young man blessed with the odd gift of luck ; he virtually cannot lose at the tables . despite this prodigious talent , philip is perpetually mournful and quite indifferent about his gambling fortunes , neither taking joy in his winnings nor having the foresight to mask his abilities . consequently , he becomes an easy target for those who would ride upon his coattails and take advantage of his talent . louise ( rebecca demornay ) , a sultry lounge singer , insinuates herself into philip ' s life for the purpose of swindling him , while philip ' s estranged brother ( and , conveniently , louise ' s ex - beau ) johnny ( michael madsen ) arrives on the scene . ( to add some colour , johnny also happens to be toting their father ' s corpse , sans one hand . ) meanwhile , philip is also befriended by a trio of low - rent , opportunists ( frank whaley , billy bob thornton , and richard edson ) , who have every intention of taking advantage of their new buddy ' s gift with the dice . serenely overlooking the chaos from behind the scenes is the casino owner ( delroy lindo ) ; it is probably not giving away much to reveal that his role in the winner is essentially that alluded to at the end of the flashy sequence in martin scorsese ' s casino which details the organization hierarchy of a casino ' s operations - he * is * the eye in the sky . it could be maddening to endure a film whose central protagonist is so oblivious of the ongoing blatant manipulation , but fortunately this is not the case in the winner , if only because our sadsack hero is such a sap ; not even remotely sympathetic or compelling , it becomes impossible to root for philip or even care about his fate , and the would - be swindlers of philip ' s fortunes are all drawn out as such ludicrous , transparent buffoons with entirely unimaginative and uninteresting schemes that one watches the winner with a complete sense of disinterest . it is a shame , as the winner features a talented cast - mr . d ' onofrio is an underrated and gifted actor with a huge range ; mr . lindo has a remarkable screen presence which infiltrates every film in which he appears ; mr . madsen , ms . demornay , and mr . whaley have all done good work in the past . none of the actors in the winner are in top form here , and this film won ' t likely be a prized addition to their respective resumes . director alex cox does what he can with wendy riss ' screenplay , and it is to his credit that this film at no point feels like an adaptation of a stage play ; i was startled to learn that the winner was in fact based upon one . while tedious , the film is well - paced and does not meander , but it would be near - impossible task for mr . cox ( or , for that matter , virtually any other director that comes to mind ) to overcome the film ' s widespread shortcomings in plot and characterization . to his credit , my understanding is that he has chosen to distance himself from the project in acknowledgement of its deficiencies . i caught the winner at its world premiere at the toronto international film festival in september 1996 , and in fairness it is entirely possible that the film has been extensively revamped since then due to the lacklustre audience reaction generated - there were more walkouts on this film than any of the others i screened . to be honest , though , i couldn ' t begin to isolate what could be done to this film to improve it - i assume that throwing the whole thing out and starting over is out of the question . the winner has apparently played on cable television in the united states and is beginning a limited theatrical release at the time of this writing . the film has a nice upbeat score by pray for rain , but i am honestly not being facetious when i state that the thing i treasured most about my screening of the winner was the bag of popcorn upon which i was munching .\",\n",

s are also the order of the day with mission to mars . dialogue and character motivations are all lifted directly from countless other science fiction films that have all done it better and with more style ( even independence day , which lifted all of it \\' s premises from other sci - fi films was better than this film , and i don \\' t like independence day ) . films like 2001 : a space odyssey , the abyss , and close encounters of the third kind are all blatantly stolen from ( and poorly at that ) . there is even a sequence where a rover is traveling through a canyon , and i couldn \\' t help but whisper \" u \\' tinni \" to myself and wait for a jawa to quickly hide in the rocks before the rover could get a glimpse of it . this film also features one of my all - time least favorite movie clich ? s : the \" he would have wanted you to have this \" moment , where one character gives another a trinket that yet another character is established as constantly having ( and is usually made fun of by the character who ends up getting all sappy over it later on ) . scenes like these always bother me when they come out of nowhere in regular films , but in a film as clich ? ridden as this , it is particularly irritating . ennio morricone \\' s music is usually considered to be some of the best stuff in the projects he works on , but here it is dreadfully overbearing . his music sounds like it came straight out of a vincent price movie in certain scenes . at other times his music is unbearably over - dramatic . one sequence involving a daring spacewalk rescue is given a particularly cheesy sting when it is discovered that the grappling hook device used for the rescue won \\' t reach its intended target . mission to mars is push button filmmaking to the greatest extreme . events are set into motion that are obvious to anyone who has ever seen a movie and seem like they are just there to evoke an emotional response in the audience . we are apparently supposed to be upset that tim robbins character removes his helmet in deep space and kills himself to save his wife , but i felt extreme boredom coupled with a twinge of disinterest . what makes it all worse is that fact that there is no real reason that robbins \\' character needs to turn himself into a popsicle , except to invoke an emotional response ( i could think of at least one way to save him , and the nasa clowns in this film are supposed to be \" smarter \" than i am ) . during the finale , when we are finally introduced to the translucent , conehead , kitty - faced aliens that we ostensibly sprung from , we are presented with some of the most ridiculously cartoonish cgi ever put to film ( just slightly worse than the plane crash at the end of air force one or the hell scenes in spawn ) . a brief history lesson about \" where we came from \" is proffered , then sinise is whisked away to be with \" the rest of our people \" ( he does this because his late wife proclaims in a video he watches early on that \" this is a chance to step foot where no one else has \" ) . > from the press i \\' ve been seeing this film receive , it is apparent that mission to mars will be dying a quick death at the theater . i \\' m sure the first weekend or two will be huge , but once word gets out people will stop going . let \\' s just hope the upcoming red planet is better than this and isn \\' t hurt by the negativity this film is generating . i \\' d venture to say it won \\' t be worse than this waste of time .

       " ('\" psycho meets the exorcist with no holds barred \" . a blurb like that sounds like desperate publicity for some low budget , third rate rip - off . but no , this tacky plug comes from the poster for suspiria , perhaps italian horror director dario argento \\' s most consistently successful film . what impresses most in re - watching this surrealistic , supernatural thriller is that argento \\' s directorial flair and stylish visuals are matched by a near - fully coherent narrative . screenplays have always been his achilles heel ; confusing subplots , gaping holes , totally illogical incidents and reactions . no question : argento has always been a better director than a writer . fortunately , he gets the plotting pretty well right with suspiria , taking his cue from a book by thomas de quincey called \" suspiria de profundis \" . the film \\' s storyline suffers from no major lapses in logic , provided one can accept the premise of a ballet school being a front for a coven of witches . jessica harper plays an american who travels to germany to further her studies in dance . arriving at the school late at night in driving rain , she sees a girl leave and run into the storm in a clearly distressed state . what happens next - and i don \\' t make the comparison lightly - is a murder sequence that for intensity , shock value and sheer directorial flair ranks alongside alfred hitchcock \\' s infamous shower scene in psycho . it \\' s quite possibly a homage to hitchcock , but with its baroque sets , graphic gore and brilliantly chaotic musical accompaniment by the gothic rock group goblin , this stunning sequence remains very much argento \\' s own . though nothing else quite equals the intensity of suspiria \\' s opening 15 minutes , the film continues to be never anything less than engrossing as harper begins her own investigations and slowly comes to realise this is no ordinary ballet school . we meet an assortment of slightly sinister characters , most notably the head ballet teacher played by alida valli in another one of those delicious sour - old - matriarch - from - hell roles she does so well . several more violent murders ensue , including a startling scene in a deserted square where a blind man is . . . well , i wouldn \\' t want to spoil things now , would i ? and the film \\' s climax , staged amid secret corridors and hidden rooms , has a gothic ghoulishness that \\' s most impressive . the english language versions of most argento movies usually suffer trimming , and not just for the violence - deep red and phenomena , for example , have been appallingly hacked about . fortunately , the cuts to suspiria ( about 7 minutes in this version ) have not adversely affected the film . the dubbing of the italian actors into english is quite competently done , too , excepting one appalling and unintentionally hilarious effort with a conversation between harper and a professor about the history of witchcraft in the region . and the soundtrack ? it is interesting to imagine what power the film would have lost if it had been scored by someone else . as it stands , the use of goblin \\' s music in suspiria is outstanding . apparently , argento played the soundtrack on location while filming so the actors could hear the music as they acted out their parts . a stereo video player adds greatly to the viewer \\' s overall experience . even better , see suspiria in a cinema , where you \\' ll get the added bonus of widescreen . and the colours ! deep reds , eerie blues , a superb use of shadow and contrast . the cinematography of luciano tovoli , whose more recent credits include reversal of fortune and single white female , is uniformly superb . a nod also must go to production designer giuseppe bassan for his wonderful baroque interiors . these kinds of settings are crucial to the atmosphere of argento \\' s more surreal excursions , the other most notable example being inferno ( 1980 ) on which bassan also worked . suspiria is the film that broke dario argento into the major league of european directors , and it is fully deserving of its cult status . the gore is at times a little excessive and overstated - that \\' s always been one of argento \\' s shortcomings - but overall this is a fascinating , compelling example of italian horror .',\n",

       " (\"the plot of big momma ' s house is martin lawrence in a fat suit and a dress . that ' s not just the high - concept premise ; it ' s the fully - realized , all - encompassing plot . such an emphasis is not unheard - of in the world of hollywood summer entertainment . one need merely look back to last summer , when the plot of big daddy was adam sandler being an incompetent surrogate parent . the trap inherent in such an approach is that the high - concept plot idea better be pretty well - realized , or rest on the shoulders of an extremely talented performer , because you can bet there will be nothing else worth a second of your time -- not a developed character , not a provocative theme , not a witty twist . you will get 90 - plus minutes of martin lawrence in a fat suit and a dress -- nothing more , nothing less . those who find martin lawrence more than an occasionally amusing screen presence may have a shot at enjoying the one - note dud that is big momma ' s house . others will simply stare , mouth agape , at its sheer unapologetic laziness . lawrence plays fbi agent malcolm turner , an undercover expert on a stakeout assignment with his partner john ( paul giamatti ) . dangerous convicted bank robber and murderer lester vesco ( terrence howard ) has escaped from prison , and the feds think he ' s headed for his former girlfriend and presumed - but - never - proved accomplice sherry ( nia long ) . sherry , however , has fled with her son trent ( jascha washington ) , possibly to visit her grandmother hattie mae ( ella mitchell ) , better known as big momma . indeed , sherry appears to be on her way , but big momma is headed out of town without knowing sherry is coming . that leaves master of disguise malcolm to go under very heavy cover as big momma and find out what sherry knows . big momma ' s house ' s bloodlines are certainly traceable to mrs . doubtfire -- director raja gosnell edited that film , and the makeup effects were similarly created by greg cannom -- but there ' s just as strong a whiff of tootsie in the main character ' s attempt to use his alternate identity to get closer to a woman . unfortunately , big momma ' s house makes a ridiculous decision neither of those other films made : instead of having the protagonist pose as a completely manufactured character unfamiliar to anyone elses , it places malcolm in the position of playing a friend and family member to several other characters . suspension of disbelief in big momma ' s house requires you to believe every other person in the film is blind and / or stupid , since no one notices that one big momma looks or sounds absolutely nothing like the other . of course , laughs trumps logic every time , and big momma ' s house probably still would have worked in spite of its utter disdain for common sense if it had just managed to be funny . and it misses its best possible opportunity for some great farce by ignoring the simple fact that the real big momma is set up as a foul - tempered beast , while malcolm has to be nurturing in order to get the information he wants out of sherry . unfortunately , no one involved appears to have the faintest idea how to deal with the comic gold mine involved in one real person pretending to be another , very different real person , so they fall back on an endless parade of sight gags : malcolm reacting violently to big momma ' s explosive diarrhea attack ; malcolm - as - momma schooling a pair of cocky teens in basketball ; malcolm trying to avoid detection as various prostheses give way at inopportune moments ; malcolm delivering a baby because big momma is the town midwife ( one of the few sequences that works ) . martin lawrence can be likeable enough at times , but there ' s no reason to care a whit about his budding romance with sherry because malcolm is never an independently significant character . he ' s just big momma without the makeup on . i won ' t waste time commenting on how ineptly the set - up of the escaped convict is employed , since it was clearly a waste of time to the film - makers . there are a few token scenes of lester looming as a threatening figure , but he ' s ultimately a distraction in a film that ' s really about its central visual incongruity ( and the accompanying lascivious glances at nia long ' s posterior ) . i ' m never prepared to underestimate how appealing that idea may be to other people -- several million of them apparently found adam sandler as an incompetent surrogate parent appealing -- but i know that when a film - maker tries to throw a concept at me and pretend that it ' s an entire film , i duck out of the way . the gross implausibility of big momma ' s house might have been tolerable if it was seasoned with more big , cleverly - constructed laughs . its lack of big laughs might have been tolerable if its characters were at all relevant . big momma ' s house is ridiculous _and_ not funny . it ' s just a sad exercise in the jaded presumption that any scene should be considered wacky and hilarious if it involves martin lawrence in a fat suit and a dress .\",\n",

( even the star trek movies dropped the numbers from their titles after star trek vi . ) the makers of watchers reborn probably want to fool unsuspecting video rental customers into thinking this might be a good movie instead of a crappy fifth installment of a film series which should have died a long time ago . this really isn \\' t a good movie . have you ever rented a movie and recieved a sinking feeling about it when you watched the previews preceding the feature presentation ? well , any hope a viewer may have had , perhaps because he is a fan of novelist dean koontz or actor mark hamill , will be dashed by the time he \\' s seen the trailers tagged on before the beginning of watchers reborn . they \\' re awful . these commercials cover films like a strange stripper movie called shadow dancer , some weird crap about a dead indian , teens , and wolves , and an \" action \" movie called detonator starring scott baio . scott baio ! what idiot dreamed this movie up ? after surviving these abysmal trailers , the person finally gets to watch the movie he rented : watchers reborn . \" maybe it won \\' t be * that * bad \" he may say to himself . \" perhaps , just perhaps , the bottom - of - the - barrel film fluff advertised before it is greatly misleading . watchers reborn , after all , is based on that cool book dean koontz wrote a decade ago . it stars mark hamill -- luke skywalker himself from that terrific star wars trilogy . lou rawls is even in the mix ! \" unfortunately , the force is certainly no longer with mark hamill ( he looks very sick here ) , and this movie shares only basic plot elements with watchers , the book . the latter is really too bad . koontz is a hack writer producing way too many thrillers for his own good , but he is still my favorite hack writer . koontz has a writing style which is succinct and suspenseful . people who read many of his books , however , often complain of repetitive plot devices . it \\' s definately not a koontz book if there isn \\' t ( 1 ) a psychic , ( 2 ) a super - intelligent dog , or ( 3 ) a psychotic killer who likes ripping out people \\' s eyeballs . watchers has all three devices , which may explain why it \\' s arguably the most popular of koontz \\' s books . the idea behind koontz \\' s novel , though highly implausible , is very interesting . basically , a biological war machine is created : a smart dog can be released in battle , track down its target , and then relay the target \\' s position , psychically , to a large creature designed to kill in hand - to - hand combat . silly but kind of neat too . i \\' m sorry . i don \\' t mean to ramble on about matters not directly linked to watchers reborn , the movie . i suppose i just don \\' t want to talk about the movie itself . this turkey is really cheesy . no one in this movie can act , including mark hamill , and it \\' s difficult seeing the aged luke skywalker stumble around trying to be the hero . the cheese factor is only increased when he \\' s involved in an implied sex scene with the blond biologist / geneticist / zoologist / whatever - the - f * * k - she \\' s - supposed - to - be whom he befriends . mercifully , the filmmakers opted not to do nudity . to be honest , the only half - convincing actor in the film is the golden retriever who plays einstein . you know a movie is bad when a dog outacts all of its human counterparts . i find it difficult to relate how laughable the action sequences are in this movie . and the creature ! yes , the creature out after poor einstein is some guy in a furry suit and a mask which poorly imitates the werewolves in the howling . this creature is shot about 500 , 000 times , but it \\' s okay . the creature has the ability to kill people by swinging his arms around and pushing . oh , he can also rip body parts off , allowing for many scenes of fake hands and arms being thrown around . cheesy gore . that \\' s another main element of watchers reborn . it has many bloody scenes which are thoroughly unconvincing and only increase the film \\' s campiness rather than its suspense . ultimately , i gave watchers reborn a star and a half because bad horror / sci - fi film buffs may get a few kicks out of the film \\' s silliness ( though this film will tax even their patience -- it \\' s an 83 minute film , but it feels like four hours ) . also , i hate to admit , i have survived far worse than this . anyone who has sat through the christopher lambert and natasha henstridge debacle known as adrenalin : fear the rush will know what i mean . finally , i couldn \\' t help but think that watchers reborn would work well as \" bot fodder \" for the creative folks behind one of my all - time favorite shows , \" mystery science theater 3000 . \" this thought alone helped me survive watchers reborn with a smile on my face . rated r , watchers reborn contains dozens of blood - spattered bodies and unconvincing gore . it also has violence , obviously . i wouldn \\' t recommend it for the little kids , but i \\' m sure even young teens would make it through this movie okay . instead of watching this film , however , i recommend reading koontz \\' s book . trust me , it \\' ll be time much , much better spent .',\n",

       " ('every once in a while you see a film that is so effective in delivering the goods that it is easy to forget , and forgive , its glaring imperfections . such is the case with ? good will hunting ? , a subtle character study about a socially inept mathematics genius who struggles to find his path in life . despite some serious character problems , this is still a very good film . you probably know about the plot so i ? ll make it quick . will hunting ( damon ) is a janitor at m . i . t . , he ? s really smarter than einstein but nobody knows it . he likes to go out with his friend chuckie ( affleck ) and their other working - class buddies and drink beer . he ? s good - looking , charismatic , and witty but has a terrible time with authority and stiff college folk . after getting into a tiff with the law , a distinguished professor ( skarsg ? rd ) discovers will ? s genius and offers him a chance to clean up his record and avoid jail time , at a price : he must attend weekly sessions with a therapist and work on various mathematical problems ( that have stumped the academic elite ) with the professor . after outsmarting and scaring the hell out of a couple of different psychologists he meets his match when hooked up with a once - promising therapist named sean maguire ( williams ) who has his own problems . in the meantime will meets a british medical school student ( driver ) and they begin to fall in love . the story starts out well enough and is a pretty original basis for a film . even though we ? ve seen movies about misunderstood , erratic prodigies before ( ? shine ? ring a bell ? ) , the script here creates a complex narrative that doesn ? t just focus solely on one character . alas though , this is not a perfect film , as much as you feel like it could ? ve been while watching it . the one real problem i had with it is the unrealistic nature of the main character . is it possible for a lowly janitor to be this intelligent ? of course . is it possible for him to be estranged from any deep , human relationships ? usually , yes . but , is it possible for him to also be so handsome , funny , quick with the tongue , and city - street tough ? not very likely . come on , usually these guys are total nerds who can ? t even buy their own shirts , much less talk down a harvard student in a hip pub while picking up phone numbers from pretty med . - school girls . will is just a little too perfect , and in order to accept the character your disbelief suspension needs to be in excellent working condition . the heavy - handed , anti - war statement made by will at a government job interview late in the film is also boorish , overlong , pompous , and completely unnecessary . all this sounds pretty bad , but the film somehow makes up for it in other ways . damon ? s acting overshadows the fact that the character is slightly unbelievable , his performance is truly extraordinary . which leads me to the really good part of the review . the strength of this movie can be summed up in one single word : acting . i can ? t recall seeing a film recently that was so well - acted from top to bottom . from minnie driver ? s frustrated lover to ben affleck ? s laid - back best friend , and all the small roles in between , the performances are magnificent . robin williams ? skill is a given as a bereaved psychologist who could ? ve had a legendary career but was knocked off the path somewhere down the line . the real gem though is stellan skarsg ? rd ? s turn as professor lambeau , an award - winning mathematician who feels reduced in comparison to a younger , smarter will hunting . the scenes between williams and skarsg ? rd , as two old college pals who ? ve been brought back together by this enigmatic kid , display some of the best acting i ? ve ever seen . when i say delivering the goods , this is what i ? m talking about . watching these two work is what going to see movies is all about . gus van sant ? s ( to die for , drugstore cowboy ) cold , urban direction is right on , as well as danny elfman ? s sauntering musical score . i highly recommend ? good will hunting ? . despite its faults , it is still an intriguing and fascinating film and you are not likely to see a better acted one this year .',\n",

( then again , maybe my first thought is correct , i think i \\' ll try pointing their shadow out to them one day and test their reaction . ) when i hear people praising this film , i never hear them talking about what makes up about 97 % of this movie : three kids bickering with each other about being lost . they only talk about what might make up possibly 3 to 4 minutes of screen time . this being a few very short night scenes where the kids hear some unscary sounds and another where they shout \" josh ! ! \" over and over . this film should not be called the blair witch project , it should more accurately be called three dumb and pisspoor filmmakers get lost . . . and argue with each other . oh ladies and gentlemen you will be so scared when you hear them shouting \" josh ! ! \" . and if you thought that was scary , wait till you see a pile of rocks , and then some tinkertoy lincoln logs , oh my dear lord you will be pissing in your pants with fear . oh yeah , and some goo on one of their backpacks . you \\' ve never seen terror like this folks , and you don \\' t want to . the chevy chase / goldie hawn comedy foul play is creepier than this film . ( for current films , i highly recommend the sixth sense or a stir of echoes for a creepy filmgoing experience . ) this film is an example of marketing with no substance . the marketing was brilliant , and the whole nation is in awe of just the premise for the film . they want this film to be good . and i think they are reaching and praising the wrong movie because they don \\' t have anything else to praise . that wonderful film that rejuvenates the horror genre may come along , but this is not it . this film could have been so much better . just think , if maybe there had been only 10 minutes of arguing about being lost , and 80 minutes of nighttime stuff . i saw this movie with a girl who was extremely pumped for it . she was sold on this film . and then , at one point during it , she turned to me and asked \\' . . . are we supposed to be scared by this ? \\' . i \\' ve heard one opinion that you \" have to use your imagination \" to create the fear in this movie . well , i thought that was what the filmmakers were supposed to do . use their imagination and create a good movie . i mean anyone can use their imagination and not pay 5 bucks for it . but even if you like this idea , then what are you imagining ? an entity called the blair witch ? some rednecks fucking with these kids ? are either of these things really scary when you think about it ? ? ? i \\' ve heard several people say that this movie makes them recall how scary it can be to be out in the woods and hear something . well sure thats scary in real life , but there are a lot of things that are scary in real life that are not scary in a movie nor even interesting . you could sit in your house and see a snake or a spider and it could be scary , but in a film it wouldn \\' t be . and no , a movie does not need a big budget or cgi special effects to be scary or creepy . actually the less the better ( see the equally awful remake of the haunting ) . but you have to do something . you cant just count on us all having nostalgic memories of how something like this could be scary , if it were real . and by the way , about the shakycam filming in blair witch . aren \\' t these supposed to be \" filmmakers \" who should know how to point a camera and shoot something without shaking the camera constantly ? i \\' m not even talking about the couple scenes where they are terrified , that \\' s justified . i \\' m talking about the other 87 minutes of the movie where they can \\' t seem to shoot anything smoothly at all . minor quibble there . there is a feeling in me that the people that like this movie are suckers . that the filmmakers are just laughing their asses off all the way to the bank . and i think there is a good chance they will see this film again and say to themselves \" what was i thinking ? ? \" . but , if they don \\' t , then thats fine . if it works for them then that \\' s okay i guess . i just lament that by making this movie a hit , we are going to be subjected to more of the \" nothing is more \" approach . pretty soon we \\' re going to get some movies like this : just a still shot of a prison jail cell . for 90 minutes . and we \\' ll have to use our imagination and think to ourselves , \" my god , wouldn \\' t it be scary to spend life in prison ? ! ! this movie is the scariest movie of all time ! ! ! ! ! \" . or , a shot of a coffin , with some funeral directors arguing with each other . \" man , do you know how scary it would be to die ? ? ? ! ! ! ! now this is the scariest movie of all time ! ! ! ! \" [ r ]',\n",

       " (\"synopsis : rumored to be about a true person , the story of mulan has circulated in oral tradition for over a thousand years , and has inspired operas , literature , and even coinage . ( since 1984 , china has been issuing annual gold and silver coin sets commemorating famous historical figures ; the 1992 set includes mulan . ) in the ballad of mulan ( written in the 5th or 6th century ) , an imperial edict by the khan ( emperor ) orders men from each family to be drafted into the army to defend china . a girl ' s parents hear sighing , and think that their daughter mulan ( the name means magnolia ) is dreaming of boys , but actually she ' s dreading what horrors might befall her old infirm father if he were to be drafted off to battle . mulan bravely runs away , masquerading as a boy , to serve in the army instead of her father . ten thousand miles and twelve years of brutal war later , the army finally returns in triumph . the emperor wants to reward mulan ' s valor with a prestigious position in government , but she declines , accepts a horse , and returns home quietly to don her true clothes . mulan ' s old army buddies visit and get the shock of their lives when they find out that mulan is actually a woman . the disney animated feature mulan is similar to the ballad story , only it adds a modern character for comic relief : mushu the dragon ( eddie murphy ) . in disney ' s mulan , when a fierce army of invading huns threatens to overrun peaceful china the emperor orders one man from each family to be conscripted into the army . old mr . fa ( soon - tek oh ) is handicapped and has no son ; he has only his spirited young daughter mulan ( ming - na wen ) . fearing for her father ' s life , the courageous mulan secretly cuts her hair , disguises herself as a man , and sneaks off to serve in the army in her father ' s stead . meanwhile mushu , the disgraced and demoted guardian dragon of the fa family , has been reduced to the size of a squirrel and the status of incense burner . ( his only duty is to ring a gong . ) mushu hits upon a plan to redeem himself and regain his guardian status by helping the disguised mulan to become a macho male warrior hero . with the help of mushu , a horse , and a lucky cricket , can army recruit mulan save china and bring honor to the fa family ? opinion : east meets west . i know a chef in santa fe that does this sort of magic ; he combines asian culinary influences from the west coast with latin american from down south and european from the atlantic to concoct new creations that hit just the right combination of flavors . from their state of the art animation studio in orlando , disney is hoping to work the same kind of east / west magic with mulan . i mean , what would you say if i told you that a new movie featured tang dynasty art , with donny osmond singing , ming - na wen acting , and eddie murphy playing a chinese dragon that makes pop references to batman and the reverend jessie jackson ? yet this is the case in the disney ' s re - interpretation of the familiar chinese classic . the end result is spectacular ; mulan is one of disney ' s best movies ever . personally , i ' m also glad to see the detestable american stereotype of the weak - willed subservient asian woman take a beating : mulan is portrayed as a normal , if spirited , compassionate gal capable of taking the initiative . mulan is more than just eastern graphics and faces combined with westernized pop and disney . kids of any age will like the family themes , and will understand the good guys versus bad guys thing . and adolescent and preteen girls can appreciate the romance factor , while the boys admire the battles . and adults can admire those male / female nuances as well as the interplay between traditional notions of family , honor , and duty with industrial age notions of romantic love , gumption , and questioning . but even the tiniest details reveal quality . the movie ' s art supervisors spent three weeks in china researching the right look : negative spaces , positive detail , period clothing , and graphic designs typical of the time and place . computers were used for crowd scenes of up to 30 , 000 people , and a special program called ' attila ' was used for a spectacular sequence involving 2000 attacking huns on horseback . and singers osmond and salonga are at the top of their game . balance is crucial . a movie about a chuckling lone dragon played by eddie murphy might not be disney ' s cup of tea , but if you use the character as a comic sidekick to balance a determined and spirited heroine , then , pow ! the dream team . by the same token , a tale about a girl in the army might be a sober exercise in filial piety by itself , but toss the dragon in there and you ' ve got enough wahoo individualism for a light hearted disney romp . it ' s rare that a movie can seamlessly combine elements from both east and west , old and young , male and female into a cohesive and entertaining whole , but mulan hits the universal bullseye . it ' s movie for any age , creed , gender , or color .\",\n",

       " ('mpaa : not rated ( though i feel it would likely be pg , for martial - arts violence . ) with three movies already ( re ) released theatrically in america , and at least three more on their way , jackie chan is one of the newest \" hot properties \" in action adventure stardom , and it \\' s just about time . for over twenty - five years , jackie \\' s been starring in martial arts and action movies in hong kong , thrilling audiences with both an incredible grasp of acrobatics and martial arts and a wonderful sense of comedy . \" drunken master \" has the distinction of being the first jackie chan movie to \" make it big \" -- this is the movie that supposedly set jackie up for big stardom in hong kong . i \\' m not entirely sure why , exactly . in many ways , \" drunken master \" is similar to most of jackie \\' s other early films , such as \" fearless hyena \" i and ii , \" master with cracked fingers \" , \" half a loaf of kung fu \" , \" spiritual kung fu \" , and others . in fact , looking at all these early films together , one gets the impression that they were stamped out , cookie - cutter style , at a rate of four to six per year , all using the same casts and telling very similar stories . to be honest , i think that early jackie chan movies are something of an acquired taste . they \\' re quite different from action movies as we know them in america . these films tend to be set in the chinese countryside in an indeterminate period sometime in the distant past , with fairly slow plots that often meander far afield and sometimes seem to exist only for the intention of stringing comedy and fight scenes together . \" drunken master \" , though its plot is tighter than some , is no exception . ( as an aside , \" drunken master \" was the first jackie chan movie i ever saw , and i saw it the way it was meant to be seen . . . in a movie theater in seattle , as part of an asian film festival . at the time , i didn \\' t really think it was anything special . . . but after having seen more films like it , it \\' s kind of grown on me . ) \" drunken master \" \\' s storyline is very similar to that of other early jackie chan movies , such as \" fearless hyena \" i and ii and \" master with cracked fingers \" -- slacker martial arts student is taught the martial arts by a harsh - seeming master , and has a big fight with an evil bad guy in the end ( a formula that has been \" adapted , \" to put it kindly , by american films such as karate kid ) . more specifically , jackie chan plays the part of wong fei - hong , aka \" naughty panther , \" a fun - loving , practical - joking kung fu student who is too good at kung fu for his own good , but not _quite_ good enough . after embarrassing his instructor \\' s assistant by beating him roundly , then beating up a bully in a marketplace , wong fei - hong tries to hit on a pretty girl , but discovers that she , and her mother , can hit back , better than he can . . . and is further chagrinned to discover that the two women are his cousin and aunt , respectively . his father , wong kei - ying , is unhappy about this , and is further annoyed when the father and brother of the bully show up to sue for damages . kei - ying soon institutes a harsh regimen of punishment , which fei - hong does not like at all . while escaping from this punishment , fei - hong meets up with a drunken old man , who proceeds to thrash him soundly , then take him on as a student and thrash him some more . this turns out to be su hua - chi , a legendary master of drunken - style kung fu . he assigns fei - hong a series of bizarre tasks , such as filling jugs with water while hanging upside down from a frame , cracking walnuts with his hands , and other such exercises , that seem like more pointless cruelty but are actually strengthening him up . then , when he \\' s ready , he teaches him the seven styles of drunken kung fu . unfortunately , the lazy fei - hong only practices six of them . . . \" drunken master \" features some wonderful martial arts sequences , with jackie winning some fights and losing others . it \\' s been said before , but i \\' ll say it again -- these fights don \\' t just _happen_ , they \\' re as carefully choreographed as any ballet performance , and it shows . in his fights , jackie often makes use of objects found in his environment -- benches , jugs , cups , bowls , fruits and vegetables -- often in new and surprising ways . the fight scenes , particularly those toward the end of the film , are unparallelled in most american films . whether jackie wins or loses , it \\' s really something to see . . . and it \\' s often as funny as anything , too . and funny is the other thing jackie chan is very , very good at . there \\' s very little that \\' s new in this movie -- jackie winning fights , jackie getting beaten badly by a master , jackie going through punishment or training . . . these schticks have all been seen before , in any one of several dozen similar jackie movies from the seventies and early eighties . but they \\' re still hilarious as ever . likewise , jackie has a _great_ supporting cast , many of whom were also in other early jackie films , and they \\' re often the source of plenty of hilarity on their own . the really big thing about \" drunken master \" , though , that inspired several copycats ( including a couple starring jackie himself ) and a sequel fifteen years later , was the drunken - style kung fu . i \\' m not certain whether or not this is actually a genuine style of kung fu , but the principle behind it is to imitate the wobbly movements of a drunkard to lull the enemy into a false sense of security . . . and it apparently helps if you \\' re drunk while you \\' re doing it . genuine or not , i have to admit , there \\' s just something incredibly fun about watching a fellow who looks utterly sloshed wading into a group of startled opponents and making mincemeat out of them before they even realize what \\' s going on . come to think of it , perhaps this element is what accounts for this film \\' s success over any of the other jackie films . . . it \\' s not just martial arts , it \\' s the kind of martial arts that makes you stop and go , \" whoa . . . \" on the negative side , the cinematography in this film is nothing special , the film stock is rather primitive , the plot is often rather slow , and the subtitles are sometimes extremely hard to read against the background . \" gone with the wind \" , this isn \\' t . still , if you like martial arts films , or like what you \\' ve seen so far of jackie chan and want to see more , give it a shot . it \\' s much more \" real \" than chuck norris or jean - claude van damme . you might very well like it . another interesting thing about \" drunken master \" has to do with its video availability in the us . \" drunken master \" is the only early jackie chan movie that i know of that you can find in its original , letterboxed , hong kong subtitled form , commercially available on vhs ( from magnum video , in a gold box , for about $ 10 ) . there are plenty of other early jackie films around , but these are typically either in dubbed , pan - and - scanned form or else import tapes priced for rental instead of purchase . thankfully , \" drunken master \" , at least , is available in the aspect ratio in which it was meant to be seen , at a very affordable price . if you like \" drunken master \" , take a look at the numerous other early jackie chan films that are out there ( even the dubbed ones aren \\' t really _too_ bad . . . if nothing else , you can enjoy the martial arts choreography while making fun of the dialogue ) . i particularly recommend \" spiritual kung fu \" , \" half a loaf of kung fu \" , the \" fearless hyena \" movies , and \" snake & crane arts of shaolin \" . also , the mostly - unrelated - storywise sequel , \" drunken master ii \" , will hit theaters in american release sometime later this year ( though what its american - release title will be is still uncertain ) and comes _highly_ recommended by this reviewer . also , for a rather different interpretation of the character wong fei -

it \\' s too obsessed with its orwellian message to become totally engaging , and if it weren \\' t for woody allen , it would have been just a really clever good - not - great flick . \" a bug \\' s life \" has a similar premise , and it also has disney to insure that it \\' s g - rated and not totally over kids \\' heads like \" antz \" was ( not a bad thing , believe me ) , but what it also has is a tone that \\' s completely innocent even when it \\' s also remaining perpetually clever . \" antz \" is still the more witty film , and i love it for it , and \" a bug \\' s life \" is more for general consumption , but it \\' s also more entertaining . it broadens its horizons , and when it really moves from the ant colony , it really shows us a whole new world we \\' ve never seen before , and it \\' s take on the evolution of bugs is a lot better than the one in \" antz . \" it \\' s also light and clever . the visuals are , instead of earth tones , bright worldly colors , and still gives the amazing visual technology of \" antz \" at least a worthy contender . the characters are also nicely realized - though watered - down for broad consumption , they still carry more wit than the contemporary disney animated films . the lead character , flik ( voiced by dave foley ) , is nothing more than a slightly - less neurotic z from \" antz , \" but foley makes him nearly as engaging as allen made z . instead of gene hackman playing the villain , we get the much more menacing kevin spacey as the lead grasshopper , the nicely - titled hopper . and for the romantic lead , we don \\' t get spacey sharon stone , but intelligent and hard - to - get julia - louis dreyfuss , who doesn \\' t even come around until the very final frames . not that the plot \\' s really any better than the one in \" antz \" - it \\' s basically yet another redux of \" the seven samurai , \" with an ant colony under the control of giant grasshoppers forcing them to produce a product for them or else . when flik , a bone fide inventor , creates a time - conserving apparatus that accidentally destroys the season \\' s donation , he puts them all in risk , and is sent away so that he won \\' t screw anything up with the pretense that he is searching for help to fight the grasshoppers . he runs into a group of \" warrirors \" who are , unbeknownst to him , a group of carnival bugs , and they agree to help under similar false pretenses . these bugs are an equally wonderful assortment to anything in \" toy story \" : foppish walking stick slim ( david hyde - pierce ) , german caterpillar heimlich ( joe ranft ) , quick - tempered and insecure male ladybug francis ( denis leary ) , pretentious praying mantis manny ( jonathan harris ) , his assistant butterfly hypsy ( madeliene kahn ) , spider rosie ( bonnie hunt ) , and two fleas , tuck and roll ( michael mcshane ) , who speak in undiscernable jibberish . the writers lightly touch on each bug \\' s place in bug society and the malleability thereof while making a wisecracks at everything they can , and blowing the audience away with wild visual treats . grasshoppers jumping in unison seems like a menacing earthquake . a small bird becomes an ominous mortal threat , whose usual mild - mannered squeal is a scream of death . the bug city is a modern - day metropolis , complete with fireflies temping as traffic lights and a fly sitting on the curb , holding out a cup , with a sign lying next to him that says \" kid tore off wings . \" and a rainstorm is like a giant flood , with each drop acting like a small bomb dropped at millions of miles per hour . around this , the pixar animators stage several large set pieces , like a resuce mission halfway through that is as wild and entertaining as anything this year , and a wonderfully exciting action piece at the end , a chase scene at night through the labyrinthine branches of a small thicket . meanwhile , each character gets the spotlight to be completely idisyncratic and interesting , something \" antz \" couldn \\' t do , and by the end , over the end credits , \" a bug \\' s life \" pulls it \\' s final punch , out clever - ing \" antz \" with a series of incessantly hilarious faux - bloopers that come just at the right time , when those who leave immeadiately after the final frame of a film have left , and you can brag that you were one of the elite who stayed and got the full money \\' s worth of entertainment . still , it \\' s no \" toy story . \" that film , maybe above any animated film i \\' ve ever seen , encompassed almost true perfection in story , character , and wit . it proved that it didn \\' t need to brag about it \\' s cutting edge technology to really soar ( it \\' s the least visually striking of the three computer animated films thus far , but is still the most satisfying ) , and created a perfect world of idiosyncratic delights and innocent fun . yet \" a bug \\' s life , \" as well as \" antz , \" are still amazing films , and prove without doubt , that if you \\' re gonna make a computer animated film , send it to the guys who created these three flicks , evne if they \\' re not working under the same roof .',\n",

fledged rock songs , not the over - processed fluff that passes for rock in most musicals . while mitchell remains in the center of the stage throughout the film , there is much of interest on the sidelines . miriam shor does fine work as yitzhak , hedwig \\' s lover and bandmate , conveying a great deal through expressions alone . decked out in a bandanna and a surprisingly convincing beard , she makes a mighty attractive man . as always , \" sctv \" veteran andrea martin is a welcome presence onscreen and michael pitt is beguiling as tommy , the angelic - appearing little rat . artist emily hubley adds to the magic with a string of dandy animated sequences that charm the eye while underlining the central themes of the musical . \" hedwig and the angry inch \" surrounds a weird , funny and touching story with a knockout series of songs performed by an exceptional cast . true originals do not come along very often ? don \\' t let this slip out of town without seeing it .',\n",

it sheds light on the boundaries between what is earthly and what is heavenly , and shows just how thin those boundaries are . both cage and ryan give soulful , soft - spoken performances . ryan , who is usually so bouncy and energetic , truly embodies a sadness that can only be alleviated by a heavenly touch . cage projects all his desire and longing to be human in simple , heartfelt gazes , and speaks with the comforting , knowing voice that only an angel could have . what is most striking about \" city of angels \" is that stevens has added a new ending to the screenplay , which is both unexpected and challenging . it \\' s not a formulaic hollywood ending , because it is both sad and uplifting at the same time . it doesn \\' t give the audience what it thinks it wants at the end of a romance . instead , it offers something much better , something that speaks to the depths of what it means to be human and alive . ____________________________________________ visit \" charlie don \\' t surf ! \" an eclectic collection of film reviews by james kendrick http : // www . bigfoot . com /~ jimkendrick || e - mail : jimkendrick @ bigfoot . com',\n",

       " (\"one of the most popular subplots in the entire science fiction genre is time travel . that concept , although many purists doubt its scientific credentials , spawned many interesting novels , comic books and films in the last century . however , the big grand - daddy of time travels , h . g . wells ' novel the time machine , wasn ' t written with the intention to speculate about that concept or its consequences . the author , h . g . wells merely used it as a convenient way to express his socialist views and condemn the great social gap between the rich , idle capitalist class and impoverished labour . whatever intentions wells had , the future generations of readers were less impressed by his political messages . instead they were fascinated by the idea that the strange new worlds could be explored without traveling trough space . the novel became one of great classics of science fiction genre and it natural for filmmakers to use it as inspiration . first of them was george pal , who in 1960 directed film which would , through the years , become genre classic of its own . the plot revolves about george ( rod taylor ) , victorian scientist who discovered the way to travel through the fourth dimension - time . at the eve of the new 20th century , george gathers his friends in order to present them his invention - machine that would enable him to travel through time . they are skeptical , but that doesn ' t prevent george from carrying out his plan and traveling into the future . at first , he travels slowly , seeing london as it changes through the years and three world wars . finally , after witnessing world war three , he travels far into the future , hoping that he would cease to witness wars and senseless destructions . when he finally reaches year 802 , 701 ad , at first glance , new world looks like utopia - humanity consists of young , beautiful , but idle eloi , people who are fed , clothed and taken care of by unseen machines . but , weena ( yvette mimieux ) , eloi woman , tells george about another side of the coin - in the night , her people is preyed upon by morlocs , humanoid creatures from the underworld . the time machine became the cinematic classic for the very same reason the novel became the classic in science fiction literature - the fantastic concept was a brilliant way for the authors to talk about burning issues and fears of their respective times . for h . g . wells it was frightening threat of class struggle ; for george pal and his screenwriter david duncan , who produced the film in the worst days of the cold war , it was the constant and more imminent threat of nuclear holocaust , underlined with the negative references to war throughout the movie . even the modern audience , which would be tempted to discard the film as old - fashioned , could find some values in its universal messages , fit for each era . compared with the genre films of today , the time machine is even better , and could serve as a good example how to make intelligent , thought - provoking films . of course , since this is hollywood product after all , the time machine delivers such concepts in the form of classic adventure , sometimes sacrificing plausibility for the sake of attractiveness . for example , it is hard to imagine that someone would be able to understand perfect english million years in future ; same is with morlocs degenerating into mutant monsters , while eloi remain undistinguished from the people of today . some of the final scenes , that turn victorian scientist into an action superhero , are also rather unconvincing . but , on the other hand , the film is very well directed , cleverly paced and the special effects , although definitely old - fashioned , are more than adequate for this kind of picture . the acting is good , with rod taylor in one of his most remembered roles , while in the same time alan young brings rather memorable performance as george ' s trusted friend filby . yvette mimieux , who plays weena , on the other hand , would be remembered more by her looks than by the complexity of her role . however , despite all those flaws , the time machine is a very good piece of cinema , something that connoisseurs of quality science - fiction films sorely miss these days .\",\n",

       " ('if anything , \" stigmata \" should be taken as a warning against releasing similarly - themed films relatively close to one another . of the four supernatural horror flicks released this year , it is clearly the worst . i suppose i should have seen this coming . after all , \" blair witch \" thoroughly creeped me out , \" sixth sense \" was mildly spooky , and then \" stir of echoes \" had its moments , but wasn \\' t anything i \\' d lose sleep over . clearly , the quality of the horror this summer has slowly been dropping . is it then any surprise that \" stigmata \" is the dullest , most horribly executed piece of mtv - influenced tripe i have seen in a long while ? no , not really . patricia arquette plays frankie page , a hairdresser from pittsburgh who receives a rosary as a gift from her globe - trotting mother . as it turns out , the rosary belonged to a recently - deceased brazilian priest . the priest \\' s church had been under investigation by father andrew kiernan ( gabriel byrne ) because of the mysterious appearance of a bleeding statue . father kiernan is an investigator who has made a career out of disproving supposed religious signs , but this time he believes there is something to the bleeding statue . his investigation is soon called off , however , when the frankie starts exhibiting signs of the stigmata , in which a person is inflicted with wounds like that of jesus christ . father kiernan is initially skeptical of frankie \\' s story , considering she \\' s an atheist , but once he witnesses the stigmata attacks himself , he dedicates himself to finding out what is going on . he eventually begins to suspect that his boss , cardinal houseman ( jonathan pryce ) , is concealing something that could bring down the catholic church . as it turns out , the dead priest had been working on the translation of a \" fifth gospel \" before they were excommunicated . the new rupert wainwright music video . . . i mean film \" stigmata \" is the sort of film that starts off ok and only gets worse . indeed , it would have been good if it were a music video , because it \\' s only interesting for about five minutes . i \\' m not sure what wainwright is trying to prove with his endless parade of slow - motion , double - exposure , and extreme close - ups ( whoaaaaaa ! ! ! ! ) , other than the fact that he has the most swelled head of any director in hollywood and , yes , he has been to film school . his camera trickery is interesting for a little while , but eventually , it becomes headache - inducing . what this film needed is a second audio track to be played over the dialogue ( such as it is ) , with wainwright screaming at the audience , \" see ? look at what i can do ! i \\' m an ex - cellent dir - ect - or . \" maybe then he \\' d explain why he decided to start half of his scenes with slow - motion shots of water dripping in reverse , or why he included random superfluous shots as that of an egg frying ( ooh , scary ! ) . if there was some underlying meaning behind all this camera trickery , i didn \\' t see it . just when you thought it was safe to get involved in the story , here comes a double - exposure shot of two patricia arquettes collapsing into bed for no reason whatsoever . arrrrrrrghhhh . . . then again , the superfluous camera trickery wouldn \\' t bother me if \" stigmata \" had a story or characters that were remotely engaging . though wainwright \\' s vanity certainly doesn \\' t help , he does seem to have been given a nearly unworkable script . where are plot continuity and character development when you need them ? case in point : frankie page is the character that ( i assume ) we are supposed to identify and sympathize with , but we aren \\' t given any back story on her character , or any reason to like her . the extent of her character development seems to be that she is a hard - working hairdresser ( who can somehow afford a cavernous apartment on the top floor of her building ) and she \\' s kind of cute , so let \\' s start the bleeding ! the fact that she \\' s clearly not the brightest bulb in the drawer doesn \\' t help , either . according to frankie page , what is the first thing to do after receiving mysterious wounds on your wrists and back ? go clubbing ! sure , that makes sense . arquette , byrne , and pryce give it the old college try , but their characters are so one - dimensional that they just appear to be sleepwalking . scenes between arquette and byrne that were probably supposed to be sexually charged fall almost embarrassingly flat , because the setup of the romantic subplot is so clumsily handled that it almost reaches the point of becoming laughable . even though frankie page \\' s life is falling apart before her very eyes , she still finds the time to hit on a priest who wanders in to her hair salon . even more curiously , he seems to be interested in her advances . father andrew \\' s religious doubt pops up so suddenly that it seems more silly than dramatic . as for pryce , he may as well wear a curled mustache and cackle , \" i \\' ll get you , my pretty , \" for all the depth his cardinal houseman is afforded . trust me , i \\' m not revealing anything by telling you pryce turns out to be a villain . what \\' s worse , after being faced with dull characters and the prospect of having annoying camera tricks and loud music jammed down our throats , we now have to contend with a story that starts off in one direction , veers off in another , then another , and ends up being totally incomprehensible . first of all , the film doesn \\' t even bother to explain what should be very simple plot details . how does frankie get the stigmata merely by touching a rosary ? how come an atheist like her was chosen , since father andrew mentions that only very devout believers have ever received stigmata ? actually , i \\' m not sure what frankie was posessed by . supposedly , stigmata occurs when one is posessed by the holy spirit , but the film later has her being posessed by the dead priest , and later by some evil spirit ( i think ) . which one is it ? the answer to this question , of course , is very simple : the possessing entity in each scene is determined by whichever effects and flashy camera work mr . wainwright wants to use this time . furthermore , the ending is a ridiculously neat little wrap - up , and the filmmakers compound this problem by ultimately turning the film into a diatribe against the catholic church . if you do any research at all about the gospel of st . thomas , you \\' ll find that it is not being suppressed by the church ( as the film seems to claim ) , but that it is readily available at your local library . there \\' s nothing the catholics need to worry about , though . \" stigmata \\' s \" religion is so off - base that it can \\' t be confused for anything remotely resembling the real catholic church . if they wanted to portray catholic priests as mobsters , they should have gone all - out and equipped them with sharkskin suits and tommy guns , which would have been far more interesting . i \\' m not catholic ; in fact , i don \\' t care much for the catholic church , but its cartoonish misrepresentation in this film should not be considered realistic by any means . it \\' s rare to see a film that fails on as many levels as \" stigmata \" does . it \\' s not thought - provoking , though it would like to be , and it is definitely not scary , though it pretends to be . i \\' m not sure why they tried to pass this off as a horror film , because there is absolutely nothing scary about the story . maybe it \\' s an attempt to cover up the fact that none of the scenes have any dramatic weight whatsoever . the initial shock of seeing arquette covered with blood is dulled by the fact that it happens over , and over , and over . like so many films of the mtv generation , this one suffers from overkill . so much is overdone in \" stigmata , \" that it eventually has no effect on the audience , leaving us to pick out the film \\' s ( many ) flaws . i \\' m also still trying to figure out why the quotation they take from the gospel of st . thomas is so earth - shattering . when we finally hear it , the saying sounds like something every five - year - old learns on their first day of sunday school , which means that for all its flash , the whole film is really much ado about nothing . the dog days of summer usually produce one monstrous dog , and \" stigmata \" is it .',\n",

( stars ) a side note : helping anchor the film is a perfectly matched soundtrack featuring aimee mann . her lyrics often add depth to a scene thematically while the actual music is both morose and beautiful . when she sings \" save me \" at the end , it enhances the yearning felt by the characters , just as \" wise up \" mirrors the anguish felt by all as they contemplate their lives .',\n",

( which is key to the conclusion \\' s said ambiguity ) . the performances by the three leads are abrasive at first , self - consciously \" quirky \" ; the introductory scenes are a chore . these people do grow on you because they convey genuine passion , a belief in themselves , and because they have long - term goals ; henry and simon may drink a lot of budweiser and hang out on the streetcorner , but they aren \\' t pop slackers . the story is rather classical : the tutor is a better talker than a doer , raised on books ; the timid tutee has innate talent his master only dreams of . ( shades of film school . . . ) the finished film is epic in its proportions for a story so small , and the final third does test one \\' s patience , yet henry fool is tight , hardly excessive in its length . how refreshing to see a movie this long in 1998 devoted entirely to character . and unless i nodded off , not a single building exploded . this , hartley \\' s seventh feature , is contemplative about \" the artist \" ; fortunately , we never get a sampling of simon \\' s work , and it \\' s a testament to the actors and the screenplay that by the end we can surmise what sort of thoughts would pour from these writers \\' pens .',\n",

       " ('very few people would be unaware of beavis & butt - head ( both created and narrated by mike judge ) . they are the two animated mtv characters who have the most annoying laughter know to human kind . you may have seen them on their television program , as they snigger and make lude remarks about women , anything related to sex , and the music film clips that they watch . in beavis & butt - head do america the pair finally make their big screen debut , to the delight of some , and the deplore of others . beavis & butt - head ( yes , those are their real names ) , are two very ugly teenagers with extremely warped minds driven by raging hormones . they live their lives in front of the television . the worst possible event occurs to the pair when their television is stolen . this happens as they sleep , and when they awake it takes them a few minutes just to decipher that the television has gone . beavis even tries to use the remote , though there is no television there . the two spot a van outside and two sinister looking men carrying a television . even at this point they have no idea what has happened . they look around , seeing all the evidence , but are completely oblivious to the fact that these men have just stolen their television . before the movie i knew that they were stupid , but i didn \\' t realise just how stupid . this is typical of their behaviour throughout the film . eventually they realise that their television has been stolen , so they leave their sofa to go search for a television . luck would have it that they stumble into a hotel room ( looking for a television ) where a man is awaiting two guys whose task it is to kill his wife . this man , thinking that beavis & butt - head are the assigned killers , tells them that they can have $ 10 , 000 if they \" do his wife \" . beavis & butt - head , being the ignorant fools that they are , think that he is offering them $ 10 , 000 dollars to have sex with his good looking wife . they are taken to the airport where they fly to las vegas to \" do her \" . to them , this is the best day of their lives . not only are they going to lose their virginity ( one of their lifelong aims ) , but most importantly , they will have enough money to buy a big screen tv . inevitably they become caught up in a huge crime , and unbeknown to them , are tracked across the country by the fbi . oddly enough , it is their complete stupidity that spares them from being caught , as a result the fbi is convinced they are criminal masterminds . they end up travelling right across america , visiting places such as the hoover dam and washington dc . the irony is that although they visit so many grand and spectacular locations , their one time out in the big world away from their television , they are completely oblivious to it . at old faithful they are far more fascinated with the infra - red operated urinals than with the geyser itself . beavis & butt - head essentially have the journey of their lives . they even get to meet the president . but all they care about is getting their television back , and losing their virginity . this is one of the many reasons that the film is so funny - it \\' s unbelievable just how stupid they are , and how they can be so oblivious to everything around them . the humour is certainly crude , but then beavis & butt - head are just that ; crude , lude and rude . in the end you can \\' t help but feel sorry for them , a pair of anti - social couch potatoes whose life is television . in this respect , and also with regard to authority ( such as the fbi ) mike judge is quite critical of amercian society . if you are easily offended , or find this pair particularly annoying , steer clear . otherwise , it should keep you laughing the whole way through . one note of warning : don \\' t take friends who like to imitate beavis & butt - head . . . . . you \\' ll never hear the end of it !',\n",

( cameron doesn \\' t wimp out like he does in terminator 2 ) the end of the world is the human race \\' s own fault , too . after all it is the humans that created in the evil machines in the first place . back in 1984 , when the cold war was still in full effect , the film must have been seen as a very apt metaphor for nuclear war ( another obsession of cameron \\' s ) . these days , one can read a criticism of machine - like behavior in humans . true , humanizing touches are put into paul winfield \\' s and lance henriksen \\' s detective characters , but the terminator is also able to move through the city undetected . cameron also draw parallels between the mechanical efficiency between the terminator and reese when they first arrive in 1984 la . from a technical standpoint the terminator is very well done . arnold schwarzenegger is a perfect antagonist -- unstoppable , merciless , obdurate . we are not meant to empathize with this ultimate killing machine as we are in some of schwarzenegger \\' s later works ( eg , commando ) , but fear him . cameron and hurd \\' s script basically depicts a one hour and forty - five minute chase , taking a few moments here and there to explain time travel and develop the romantic subplot . while we do see the hackneyed dialogue cameron is now so well known for , there is also considerable suspense especially for the first time viewer who may be unsure of kyle reese \\' s intentions . cameron directs the film at a rapid , kinetic pace . either the camera is moving or something within the frame is moving -- usually both occurs . the violence is not particularly graphic ( temple of doom \\' s heart - pull scene outgrosses the terminator \\' s ) , but it is brutally staged making it that much more effective . for a low budget film , the terminator \\' s special effects and art direction ( especially in 2029 la ) are remarkably well done . special mention should be made of the stop motion effects work at the end of the film depicting the terminator endoskeleton . it is some of the best stop motion i have ever seen . one thing that doesn \\' t hold up after all the years , however , is linda hamilton \\' s hairdo .',\n",

       " (\"titanic is so close to being the perfect movie it ' s upsetting that it isn ' t . the film , which cost $ 200 million + to make and could of put 20th century fox into a lot of finicial trouble if it ' sunk ' ( pun intended ) is a labour of love for cameron , who wrote and directed the film . we all know that big budget dosen ' t mean great film ( see waterworld ( 1995 ) ) but titanic is far superior to kevin costners waterlogged epic . but sadly , titanic just misses the mark of masterpiece ( although it is one of cameron ' s best films ) the film starts with present day explorers searching the runied titanic . they find a safe , and inside a picture of a woman . the woman in the picture ( an old winslet ) tells the explorers that the picture is of her . the explorers invite her over , and she then tells her story of titanic . in the flashback , dicaprio plays poor boy jack dawson , who , after winning a poker game , wins two tickets to board the grand ship titanic , leaving liverpool to go to america . also boarding the ship is rich woman rose dewitt bukater ( winslet ) who is being forced into a marriage with a man she dosen ' t love at all , cal hockley ( zane ) so her family can remain rich . she nearly commits suicide on the ship , but jack comes to the rescue , saves rose , they fall in love , and cal gets jealous and eventually tries to kill them . oh yeah , and the ship sinks . and that is the main problem with the film , and which stops it from being a work of genius . the story and script ( both by cameron ) are both weak . the story is full of cliched characters , ( the creepy man who the nice girl has to marry , the poor boy with heart , the stuck - up mother ) and poor dialogue ( the script consists of lots of in - jokes of how the boat won ' t sink , and most of the dialogue is pretty basic ) it ' s a shame really , as the audience does have to sit through 3 hours of this film . without good dialogue , a film could become a very long , very boring film ( like camerons own terminator 2 , 1992 ) but , luckily , there are some redeeming features that make the story and dialogue problems just disappear . firstly , there ' s cameron ' s direction . there are some great sweeping shots of the titanic , and some clever fades between the flashback titanic and the ruined titanic . but the scenes cameron directs especially well are the disaster scenes at the end . there is a lot of mayhem and panic , all done very well by cameron . it ' s a scary sight , watching bodies fall from great heights into the watery depths below . thanks to cameron ' s direction , then , the audiences attention is held for the full 3 hours 15 minutes . to support the directing are the excellent cast , working very well with their underwritten characters . dicaprio is good , although he only looks 16 - 17 years old . his performance of a over excitiable , yet also well mannered boy is excellent , and he also has some funny lines . winslet is great also , and her transistion from a well mannered rich girl to a rebelous young adult is pretty smooth . zane is deliciously evil as cal , saying every line with a sneer and a flicker of the eye lash . the audience really does come to hate him . he may be playing the same character he plays in every film he ' s in ( like dead calm , 1988 ) but he does it really , really well . also worthy of note is kathy bates ( edward scissorhands , 1990 ) as a loud mouthed american . finally , the icing on the ' great things ' cake are the special effects . cameron is a whiz with effects ( just watch aliens ( 1988 ) , terminator 2 and true lies , 1994 ) and they are used very well throughout . the sweeps of the ships are awesome , although digital domain , who did the effects , cannot animate human movement too well . the humans seem to move to ' smoothly ' , there ' s just something odd about them . you can tell that they have been animated on a computer . of course , the ship sinking scenes are awesome , with bodies flying all over the place , and the scene where the ship splits in half has to be seen to be believed . titanic is one of the only films where effects have reinforced the film . titanic , then , is a wonder of directing , acting and cgi , but not writing and story . again , like most of camerons films , the editing is loose ( cameron edits himself ) , and the film could of come in under three hours with a few more cuts . titanic , then , although not the godfather of movies it could of been , is a wonderful attempt at creating a work of genius . enjoyable , scary , and even sad , titanic is a film cinema was invented for , filling the screen with incredible images , and assaulting the ears with awesome sound . a superb film , but sadly not perfect . overall rating = (\",\n",

who would you guess wins ? some of the scenes would work if this were a comedy . todd \\' s first awakening of human emotion comes when he glimpses connie \\' s nipple poking through her thin blouse . later as he sits by his lonely campfire , a tear rolls down his dramatically lighted cheek in slow motion . supposedly this clich ?

a tear rolls down washington \\' s cheek -- and will probably run down your cheek as well . the episode becomes even more tragic when we learn that washington wasn \\' t deserting the army at all ; he left camp to look for shoes because his feet were covered with oozing sores . freeman is , as usual , a strong presence , even in a small supporting role . he plays a grave digger who has buried more white soldiers than he cares to remember . he quickly becomes a leader among the black soldiers , holding the group together and serving as a liaison to the white officers . colonel shaw recognizes freeman \\' s leadership ability and promotes him to sergeant major , making him the first black officer in the army . andre braugher makes an impressive film debut in the role of thomas searles , a free black who is one of shaw \\' s close childhood friends . searles is educated and refined , like a white man , prompting washington to nickname him \" snow flake . \" the burning question is whether searles is tough enough to survive basic training and to kill in combat . the road from marching drills to battle action is a bumpy one for the black regiment . the soldiers suffer innumerable hardships , but somehow they never lose their morale . the army treats the black soldiers like second class citizens , subjecting them to racism and discrimination . they are paid only $ 10 a month , whereas their white counterparts earn thirteen , and , for a long time , they have to go without shoes , guns , or uniforms . to make matters worse , the white military hierarchy is extremely reluctant to allow the blacks into action , preferring instead to use them for manual labor . eventually , however , the regiment receives its boots , uniforms , rifles , and right to fight , thanks to the stubborn resolve of colonel shaw . shaw has absolute faith in his soldiers , and he fights tooth and nail to get them what they deserve , even if it means threatening a general with blackmail . broderick , in fact , is most convincing in the scenes where shaw stands up for the regiment . unfortunately , however , broderick \\' s uneven performance is , in many respects , the weak link in the movie . in an effort to look more mature , broderick sports a mustache and a goatee , and throughout the film he slips in and out of a phony boston accent . he is never altogether convincing as shaw since much of the time his emotions seem forced . the film places too much weight on broderick \\' s character and not enough on the black soldiers , who are more intriguing . glory regains lost ground with its harrowing depiction of war . the movie shows the devastation of war without resorting to the unnecessarily graphic gore which marred born on the fourth of july . glory does not try to rattle you with nauseating blood and guts . except for a few bullet wounds and one exploding head , the film , for the most part , leaves the gore to your imagination , which is not to say that the battle scenes in glory are timid . to the contrary , they are chaotic and horrifying ; it \\' s just that director edward zwick ( the co - creator of \" thirtysomething \" ) films them with far more subtlety and restraint than oliver stone could ever muster . the key to glory is the group dynamic among the black soldiers . the movie depicts some of ( but not enough of ) their customs and rituals . in one scene , for example , the soldiers motivate themselves by singing prayers around the campfire . each man has a chance to relay a few words of inspiration . a couple of the movie \\' s most touching moments involve young black children looking up to the black soldiers with awe , disbelief and pride . the regiment \\' s greatest triumph comes when the soldiers distinguish themselves in battle , thereby earning the respect of their white peers and earning the honor of leading the climactic assault on fort wagner . like any war film , glory has its share of gloom and despair , but ultimately it proves to be a truly uplifting experience and an important history lesson , a valuable reminder that despite what the history books say ( or , more precisely , what they do not say ) , blacks played a critically important role in the north \\' s victory over the south -- forever changing the evolution of america .',\n",

       " ('city of angels is the kind of love story that i enjoy the most : thought - provoking , moving , and completely unsentimental . i find it interesting that this film has been released the same day as my giant , which is a film that is undone completely by its wretched sentimentality . city of angels is a wonderful film , enhanced by interesting and well - rounded characters and some of the most immersive imagery of the last couple of years . it \\' s a love story that takes the familiar angel themes and makes them new and necessary to the story , and avoids most of the cliches we \\' re so used to seeing in films like this . city of angels is an apparently loose remake of wim wenders \\' 1988 film wings of desire . i have yet to see wings of desire , so i am , unfortunately , unable to make a comparison of the two . i have heard , however , that city of angels is dissimilar from the original in numerous ways , which makes me glad that this film isn \\' t a rip - off of its source material . nicolas cage stars as seth , an angel who , like all of his angel counterparts , is present to lead the dying to heaven ( or somewhere just like it ) . one day , he is forced to take the life of a patient of dr . maggie rice ( meg ryan ) , and his attention is called to her . the angels can make themselves seen to humans , but they can \\' t experience any of the senses ( most importantly , touch ) . he shows himself to maggie , and she falls for him , unaware that he is slightly unavailable because of his apparition status . seth wants to become human so he can feel her . that \\' s when he meets nathaniel messinger ( dennis franz ) , \" former celestial messenger and recent addition to the human race . \" ( as a side note , i found messinger to be the most fascinating character , for i can only imagine how incredibly liberating it must be to live knowing what lies beyond death . ) messinger explains to seth that it is possible for angels to become human . seth manages to convince maggie that he is an angel ( i know , it sounds ridiculous , but the scene in which she finds out is exceptionally well - done ) ; after much deliberation , she tells him that she could only be with a man who can feel . this , of course , is when seth decides to take the plunge ( literally ) from a building ; when he wakes up from the fall , he is human , and happy to feel what it \\' s like to have a split lip and blood oozing from his forehead . since i love this film so much , i \\' ll make a minor note that it certainly isn \\' t perfect . although it is original and mesmerizing , it does fall prey to a few of the cliches of the genre . the plotting of the story by writer dawn steel is rather formulaic ( though the details are what make the story excellent , and steel has done a great job with them ) . the ending , too , could have been more powerful and less predictable . these elements are minor , though , and barely detracted from my overall enjoyment of city of angels . the acting is superb from everyone involved . this is perhaps my second - favorite performance from cage ( my favorite being the rock ) . he \\' s quiet and pensive , and his eyes are engaging when he speaks his softly - toned words . he \\' s perfect for a role like this , and at the same time he reassures us he \\' s not bound by playing the psycho ( though he is good at it , as he shows in face / off ) . meg ryan is a powerful , enticing , and appealingly - chirpy actress , and her work here is some of her best . dennis franz , however , steals all of his scenes as the energetic former - angel . what i admire most about city of angels is its overall presentation . director brad silberling is a talented man , and he knows that a story like this is driven by the characters , rather than forced sentimentality . his direction is steady , and he shows this in just about every scene : near the beginning , maggie has to tell a mother and her two children that their father is dead . there is no music or elaborate camera work ; we simply see the reactions of the characters to the information . this is the way stories should be told , and the strength of scenes resonates more completely when the emotions are real . the film also appeals to the senses in a way that few love stories do . cinematographer john seale ( the english patient ) provides some of the most stunning images i \\' ve seen on the big screen : hundreds of black - clad angels stand on a dim beach in the early morning hours ( just as an example ) . the music , by gabriel yared ( also of the english patient ) , is perfect for this film : it \\' s quiet and moody music ( but not sentimental ! ) , and adds to the atmosphere and tone nicely . the visual presentation of city of angels is easily the best of 1998 so far . all of this adds up to a film that is instantly set apart from other members of this genre . it \\' s a film that relies on character development and imagery to get the story across -- the excellent actors and the professional production values make city of angels one of those rare films that both entertains and instigates thought simultaneously .',\n",

       " (\"well , as i check my score card for what i ' ve done this holiday weekend , it reads good ideas : 0 and dumb ideas : 1 . i don ' t know what i was thinking when i decided to watch this movie . but in my defense , i can only say that it was someone else who urged me to see this with him . the film that i ' m talking about is ` a night at the roxbury , ' one of those offerings based on a saturday night live skit . wayne and garth , these two are not . rather , we meet doug and steve butabi ( the actors ' names are not worth mentioning ) , two eternal partyers whose greatest ambitions in life seem to be finding a way to get into the hottest night club in the city , the roxbury . driving in their dad ' s bmw and donning metallic disco suits right out of miami vice , they try to bribe the bouncer to get into the club . ` have you met my friend washington and his friend roosevelt , ' they confidently say as they pull out spare pocket change . their second greatest ambition seems to be oozing out as many silly pick - up lines as is humanly possible in order to start a conversation with a girl ( ` let me see that label . just as i thought - made in heaven , ' says one of the brothers ) . and , like the losers that they are , they fail to do either for much of the film . however , as fate would have it , an accidental meeting with ` what - ever - happened - to ' richard grieco gives them the all - important ticket to get in . their sad lives take on a whole new direction . they make an important contact with the club owner who believes that these two brothers have uncanny insight into the club scene . and they are mistaken as rich swingers by two voluptuous young women . but their newfound popularity does not impress their father , who has other plans for them . the unfortunate thing about this film is that this is a one - joke movie , and the brothers are the joke . actually , there ' s about 10 mintues worth of tolerable stuff . alas , too long for tv and way too short for a feature - length film . thus , there just isn ' t enough material to sustain the 83 - minute movie . there ' s no plot to be found and everything that these two do seem to culminate in an opportunity to execute their trademark move of snapping their heads in unison to the funky beat of haddaway ' s europop song , what is love . i was amazed that none of the two suffered from whiplash . to take up more film time , there is a subplot involving the daughter of the businessman next door who wants to marry doug . this creates not only friction between the brothers , but their unlikely pairing will also agitate audience members as well . she ' s educated and a forebearing witch . meanwhile , doug is a complete loser . how did these two ever get together ? i suppose that if i can ever figure out the answer to that question , i ' ll have figured out why i decided to go and see this movie . if you ' re looking for entertainment , you won ' t find it at the roxbury .\",\n",

       " ('\" . . it \\' s certainly more than just a monster story . . \" - kenneth branagh , director / actor / co - writer of mary shelley \\' s frankenstein . kenneth branagh \\' s new motion picture had to compete with all the previous frankenstein - films made throughout the years in almost every part of the world , including the most controversial version of them all - directed by james whale . the dark and stormy nights , the lightning bolts , the charnel houses of spare body parts , the laboratory where victor frankenstein stirs his steaming cauldron of life are effectful . but the center of the film , quieter and more thoughtful , contains the real story . horror - fans will probably be disappointed by the total lack of horror . branagh has instead concentrated on serious issues : morality , philosophy and human elements of the story , and not on old fashioned horror cliches . his version is much closer to the book than all the previous adaptions of the classic novel . the film begins and ends somewhere in the arctic ocean . the year is 1794 . a bold captain is steering his ship through the unknown waters . his gole is to reach the north pole at all costs . as the ice closes around his ship , a figure appears on the horizon . it \\' s a man . exhausted and on the brink of death he approaches the frightening crew . his name is victor frankenstein ( kenneth branagh ) and his story is so terrifying that it will scare everyone from venturing into the unknown . the myserious stranger begins his tale , or more precisely his confession , in geneva , 1773 . he is remembering his childhood and youth . laughter , banquets and parties - a happy life , without troubles or concerns . here victor lived with his father ( ian holm ) , mother ( cherie lunghi ) , his surrogate sister ( helena boham carter ) and his servants in happiness and harmony . this idyllic lifestyle is suddenly changed . like thunder from a quite sky , his mother dies , giving birth to his youngest brother . shocked , baffled and then gradually changed by grief and despair , victor ( already interested in science ) becomes obsessed with death . standing on his mother \\' s grave he says : \" oh mother . . you did not have to die . . . no one should ever die . . . i will stop this . . i promiss . . \" after proposing marridge to his surrogate sister and promising to return as soon as his studies are finished , victor travels to ingolstadt , in presuite of a medical career . after a while his obsession totally overtakes him as he is working day and night , creating life from death . composing dead bodies , frankenstein wanted to create the perfect man - both physically and mentally . with strong electrical impulses , he managed to breeth life into his creation . the result was ugliness . realizing what he has done , frankenstein tried to undo his work , but it was to late . the creature has escaped . because of the epidemic , frankenstein hoped that his creation has died and returned to his home , making plans for the wedding . for a while everything is as it was before his mother \\' s death . but then one by one his loved once are dying mysteriously . . . whale \\' s picture , although powerful , never managed to capture the total depth of the novel . brannagh has more or less done that . another thing is characters and actors . branagh has developed every character and assembled a magnificent cast . the greatest performances comes from de niro - the monster , that has been played by ( among others ) charles ogle , karloff , lon chaney , bela lugosi , glenn strange , christopher lee , fred gwynne ( as herman munster ) , and now , robert de niro . alone , hated and feared , he is completely aware of his ugliness . at first he is like a helpless , abandoned child , desperately reaching out for love . later when he reads frankenstein \\' s journal , and learns that he is composed of dead bodies , his love turns into rage as he is seeking revenge . he is capable of killing without regret . \" i took him by the throughout and lifted him off the ground . . . . and then i slowly crushed his neck . . . and as i killed him , i saw your face . . \" that is how he reveals his savage nature to his creator . and yet , he is never quite evil in our eyes and his vaulerbility and his loneliness are palpable : \" for the sympathy of one living being i would make peace with all . \" rarely has a cinematic interpretation of \" the daemon \" approached the level of three - dimensionality and humanity with which it is portrayed in the novel . another vital thing is the character of victor frankenstein . in most of the previous adaptions he was simply a mad scientist that trolls the graveyards for corpses and then creates a monster ( god knows why ! ) with the power of an electrical storm . almost no time was granted on his charecter , who is the most important and vital charecter in the novel . here , branagh introduces the character of victor frankenstein , establishes his obsession with the very nature of life and death , sets up the intellectual and ideological conflict between victor and the academic establishment , and somehow manages to build up to a rousing and horrifying creation scene . branagh plays frankenstein with a remarkable understanding of his character . on the outside he is strong , ambitious and talented scientist , but deep down he is unsecure , fragile and vaulerble , constantly haunted by the ghosts from his past . helen boham carter is equally wonderful as frankenstein \\' s surrogate sister , who at the end becomes his wife for a little while , before death drives them apart . the rest of the cast , playing secondary characters , is solid and nothing less than convincing . visually the film is stunning ( especially the makeup ) . the spinning camera , the constantly building - up musical acore , the art direction , the production design , the costumes are all magnificent : from the arctic ocean to the swiss alps and dark forests , to the plague - riddled streets of ingolstadt , mary shelley \\' s frankenstein is a wonder to behold . kenneth branagh directs his film as if the script was written by shakespeare : \" . . all i once loved lies in a shallow grave . . . . by my hand . . \" . and the film ends exacly as hamlet , when the creature sets both his and his creator \\' s body on fire . the film ends with frankenstein and his creation burning in the almost hellish fire in the darkness . and a terrifying last close - up on the creature \\' s smiling face . can a man create life , then abandon his creation because its appearance horrifies him ? to whom are its actions then attributable : the creature or the being who brought about its existence ? shelley did not answer these questions , but she certainly posed them . following her example , branagh does the same . his film is a tragic saga about playing god . victor frankenstein is not an evil man . he wanted to change the world to the better . in this he represents everything science stands for : acting without doubts , never considering the consequences of his actions . produced by francis ford coppola , frankenstein resembles in some respects coppolas previous film \" dracula \" . in comparison , i can say that \" dracula \" has visuals that even \" frankenstein \" can not live up to . but when it comes to story , characters and casting , \" frankenstein \" is stronger . but stronger than both of them , on every aspect , is neil jordan \\' s \" interview with the vampire \" . although the film is not perfect ( the camera that simply refuses to stay still and the occasionally pushy score are at times more tiering than effective ) , these minor faults are easily forgivable , as the picture is otherwise captivating and stimulating . branagh has probably created one of the best ( if not the best ) adaptions of shelly \\' s classic novel .',\n",

       " ('when i initially set out to review this film , my tag line was going to be \" you too can believe whales can fly \" . then it was going to be \" you too can believe pastel triangles can fly \" . then , it was going to be \" you too can believe wood sprites can fly \" . finally , i just gave up trying to come up with a tag line and decided to say . . . there \\' s a lot of flying going on in this film ! as our first host steve martin tells us , the original concept behind fantasia was to bring it out every year with some old segments retained and some new segments added in . well apparently that plan fell by the wayside for a while , because approximately sixty years have passed since the original classic was released . part of this might have something to do with the cold reception the film got when it was first released in 1940 ( grossing somewhere close to $ 110 , 000 in its original month of release ) . subsequent re - releases of the film have elevated the popularity of the film to the classic status it has finally achieved ( and rightfully deserved ) . to celebrate the release of an updated version of fantasia , disney and imax teamed up to present the animated film in a fashion no one had seen before : six stories high . in an exclusive four month engagement ( from january 1st to april 30th , 2000 ) , fantasia 2000 can be seen at many imax theaters across the us . after the engagement is over , the film will be shown at regular theaters . is the format effective for the film ? with a few exceptions , yes . the first segment we are presented with is set to beethoven \\' s fifth symphony . it \\' s hard to describe exactly what this segment is about , but it involves a bunch of brightly colored butterfly looking triangles flitting about happily . everything seems to be going great for these little things until the ground erupts with swarms of evil , black bat - like triangles that attack and engulf their lighter counterparts . eventually , shafts of light from above help drive away the evil bat - like things and peace returns to the butterfly things . though this segment isn \\' t very story driven , some of the images are very visually strong , especially the scene in which the dark cloud of bat things ( who are all outlined in blood red colors ) begin to overtake the skies . the next segment is set to ottorino respighi \\' s \" the pines of rome \" . in this segment , some humpback whales swim happily through the ocean and eventually emerge from the water and fly around the massive icebergs that pepper the oceanscape . a whale calf gets into a scuffle with some nearby birds during the flight and ends up getting trapped in a giant iceberg he smashes into while trying to avoid the birds attack . he is finally saved ( by another liberating shaft of light ) and he and his brethren take to the skies and fly into the upper atmosphere where they frolic in the \" oceans \" of clouds . again , visuals are the key with this segment , especially where the whales are involved . reportedly the whales , as viewed on an imax screen in certain sequences , are shown as actual size . the cgi whales look incredibly life - like , except for some googly cartoon eyes drawn onto the images . one especially striking image involves the giant shadow of one of the whales being cast through the wall of an iceberg as the whale calf tries to find a way out to its parent . absolutely beautiful stuff . the third segment ( and the least of the eight segments ) is set to george gershwin \\' s \" rhapsody in blue \" . this segment is designed as a tribute to acclaimed caricaturist al hirschfeld , and intertwines four different stories about sad souls living in depression era new york . there \\' s a construction worker who dreams of being a jazz drummer , an out - of - work sad sack that dreams of having a job , a young girl that dreams of spending time with her parents instead of being hustled off by a schoolmarm , and a nebbish who dreams of being free from his overbearing wife . i won \\' t go into how everything works out , but in fine disney tradition there is a happy ending . unfortunately , the story drags quite a bit and the seems out of place within the hyper reality of the rest of the segments . segment four is set to dmitri shostakovich \\' s \" piano concerto no . 2 \" and is an animated version of hans christian andersen \\' s \" the steadfast tin soldier \" . a one legged toy tin soldier falls in love with a wind - up clock ballerina ( whom he assumes is also one legged because he can \\' t see her other leg extended out behind her ) , much to the dismay of an evil jack - in - the - box jester . the jester knocks the soldier out of a window and continues pursuing the ballerina . little does the jester know , the soldier has been deposited in the sewer and has journeyed through the pipelines only to be swallowed by a fish that has been captured and sold to the owner of the set of tin soldiers that the one legged one comes from . the soldier eventually saves the day and gets the girl . although the ending has been altered from the andersen story , \" the steadfast tin soldier \" is decently told with in the framework of a seven minute short . some children may find the jester to be a little frightening , but otherwise the segment is well made . segment five is the funniest of the bunch . set to camille saint - saens \" the carnival of the animals \" , this segment features a flamingo torturing his fellow flamingos with a yo - yo while they are trying to perform a choreographed dance number . while it is the shortest clip of the group and a throwback to the alligators and hippos dancing in the first fantasia , it is still well accomplished and a welcome bit of comedy . segment six is the only segment to be repeated from the original 1940 fantasia , and it \\' s the one that people remember most , \" the sorcerer \\' s apprentice \" . the story is the most recognizable , so the draw here is seeing it on the enormous imax screen in remastered stereo . unfortunately , the segment wasn \\' t made to be presented on large format film ( considering it was shot full frame ) and exhibits large amounts of grain . there were at least two occasions where images were very hard to make out due to the excessive grain . similar problems crop up on modern day releases when projected on screens too large for the image to be shown accurately ( but no one seems to notice for some strange reason ) , an anomaly common to many 18 - plus screen theaters . segment seven is set to sir edward elgar \\' s \" pomp and circumstance march no . 1 \" and is the only other fantasia segment to feature a stock disney character . donald duck \" stars \" as an assistant to noah , whose task is loading all of the animals onto the ark . during the loading , donald and his wife lose sight of each other and both believe that the other one didn \\' t make it on the boat . they are constantly missing each other due to comic misadventures mainly involving donald being crushed by animals in various manners . despite the slapstick style of comedy in this piece , it displays more emotion in its final scene than many of the tear - jerkers foisted on audiences these days . powerful stuff . segment eight brings a whole new meaning to the clich ? \" saving the best for last \" . set to igor stravinsky \\' s \" the firebird \" , an elk awakens a forest sprite that proceeds to change the wintery landscape into a beautiful springtime landscape . trees bloom and flowers blossom and everything seems to be going well until the sprite becomes inquisitive about a large mountain housing a strange formation . when the sprite examines the formation , it awakens and becomes the titular firebird . in a stunning spectacle , the firebird rears back and unleashes and fire storm that destroys everything in its path , including everything that the sprite has worked to create . some amazing animation is present here , and well worth the ten dollars a ticket alone ( although brush strokes are evident in one scene due to the enlargement of the film ) . the host segments are largely ( no pun intended ) throwaways , although steve martin \\' s clip is pretty funny . be sure to stay through the credits for a little more humor from martin . penn and teller are usually funny , but here their gags seem routine and therefore uninteresting . the best segment comes from , of all people , bette midler , who gets to tell us about some of the abandoned segments that never made it off of the drawing board . pieces like flight of the bumblebee , a take on the four horsemen set to wagner \\' s \" ride of the valkyries \" , and a strange segment prepared in the \\' 40s by salvador dali that never was shown are all previewed here and teased that they may appear in future installments . for fans of visual stimulation or classical music , fantasia 2000 is a perfect way to spend the afternoon . the film is also decent family entertainment and contains little to no objectionable material . as i mentioned earlier in the review , if ten dollars seems like too much for you to spend on this film , fear not because after its run in imax theaters it is going to be brought out in regular theaters . i must stress that the best way to see this film is on an imax screen though . then you too can believe that whales / triangle things / sprites can fly .

       " ('because the press screening of \" planet of the apes \" was one day past last issue \\' s deadline , i was afforded the opportunity to see the film a second time , listen to audience reactions and read a heap of reviews before writing this piece . the chief complaints of those who disliked the futuristic adventure appear to be that the movie focused on visuals instead of substance , that the story was thin , that mark wahlberg \\' s character was colorless and that the surprise ending sucked . to those people i would like to say ? what the hell did you expect ? this is a tim burton movie , boys and girls . tim burton movies have great art direction and thin , clunky stories . for the blissfully nasty , disjointed and underrated \" mars attacks ! \" ( jonathan rosenbaum of the chicago reader and i were two of the only critics in america to praise the movie ) burton reportedly tossed vintage \" mars attacks ! \" trading cards onto the floor and based his story on the ones that landed face up . burton \\' s re - imagining of the 1968 story of an astronaut that lands on a planet where apes rule men looks great . the apes , courtesy of make - up magician rick baker , are dazzling and ape city is a wonder to behold . like astronaut leo davidson ( wahlberg ) , the film hits the ground running , whisking viewers through a head - spinning series of solid one - liners and engaging vignettes and establishing a sense of thrust that carries us through the more traditional fight scenes that come later . as for wahlberg , consider what burton does with his character . from his start as a filmmaker , burton has shown his fascination with colorful misfits ( pee - wee herman , the joker , ed wood , the ack - acking martians , etc . ) and lack of interest in standard issue heroes . so leo davidson spends most of the movie getting the living shit kicked out of him before the biggest guilt trip in history is dropped on his shoulders . as for lack of color , remember , leo only launches into space to get his monkey back . he doesn \\' t want to lead humanity and he isn \\' t looking for romance from a pretty , but dull human ( estella warren ) or a dynamic ape ( helena bonham carter , terrific as an equal - rights activist ) . as a man who just wants out , wahlberg is focused , subtle and sly . the surprise ending provides the requisite shock ( and some more dandy visuals , particularly of the approaching authority figures ) , but admittedly isn \\' t nearly as satisfying as the one in the original . for the original ending to work , we only had to make one simple connection , for this one , we have to write a whole new screenplay . the 1968 \" apes \" boasted a handful of great scenes , cool looking monkeys , a deliciously hammy performance by charlton heston ( who appears uncredited here as an aged chimp on his deathbed , re - delivering a classic line ) and a killer ending . but viewers had to suffer through numerous dull stretches punctuated by social and political messages delivered with the grace of a wrecking ball . the 2001 \" planet of the apes \" offers a different set of great scenes , much cooler looking monkeys , fine acting from wahlberg , bonham carter , paul giamatti and tim roth , and a not so good ending . it also gives us another chance to experience the skewed vision of tim burton and that \\' s nothing to complain about .',\n",

( before i go further , i \\' d like to make a distinction that the denver post failed to make , and that is that characterizing african - americans as malt - liquor drinking o . j . fans is not part of bulworth \\' s \" truth . \" that line is in the trailers but it should not be praised like the other political confessions he makes in the movie . when the critics praise beatty for speaking the truth about politics , this line is not what they \\' re talking about . ) the experience is liberating . with nothing left to lose , bulworth is no longer restricted to burping generic platitudes out of both sides of his mouth . he can say whatever he wants because he \\' s going to be dead anyway . why not tell the people the truth about being a sleazy politician - that he is bought and paid for by lobbyists , and that racism among the populace protects politicians from being the target of charges of classism ? bulworth \\' s candor wins him three volunteers from the church , one of whom , nikki ( halle barry ) , he gets a crush on . he feels so good afterwards that he actually eats something . chicken wings , appropriately enough . bulworth shows up late for his meeting with some movie studio executives . when one of them asks where he stands on government regulation of movie and tv ratings , bulworth drifts to the topic of the quality of filmed entertainment . with so much money and so many talented people working so hard , he wonders , why can \\' t hollywood make a quality product . ( you go , warren ! ) when they become indignant and ask why he \\' s talking to them if he has such a low opinion of their product , he callously admits that it \\' s because they are rich jews . that night he drops the three african - american volunteers at their nightclub , and he decides to go in with them . he stays up all night drinking , smoking pot , dancing , falling in love with nikki , and learning to scratch turntables and rap . the next day , he shuns his prepared speech and instead raps to the suit - and - tie fundraisers . from then on , at all of his political appearances , he raps his political truth . his rap is not bad for a middle - aged white guy . he \\' s not very good , but it is his first try and at least he \\' s not embarrassingly bad . his lobbyists are not amused , but the rest of his constituency seems to like the new bulworth . eventually , the movie \\' s plot ( remember he hired a hit man ? ) overtakes the politics , which is too bad . screen time is spent with bulworth trying to cancel the request for his assassination while the hit man seems to be closing in on him . there are even a few gratuitous chase scenes , bulworth fleeing his killer . these scenes may have been necessary to keep the events of the film moving along , but it distracted and detracted from bulworth \\' s political ranting , which was much more interesting than the ever - present , obvious - looking assassin . still , most of the movie is original and very enjoyable , and beatty deserves most of credit for bringing it to the screen . as the story and screen writer , he came up first with a good structure , then with good dialogue to back it up ( jeremy pikser co - wrote the screenplay ) . as an actor , he was able to convincingly portray bulworth \\' s depression , then liberation and rebirth . as a producer ( there were four others ) he was able to keep the movie free from hollywood \\' s indulgent formulas ( except for those inexcusable chase scenes ) . someone else probably could have directed , but since he was there anyway , what the heck . it \\' s too bad that there aren \\' t more movies like this around - movies that tackle political corruption in a way that challenges viewers to pay more attention to real politics . after all , much of the inspiration for bulworth is straight out of the news . just a little perception and insight and you could write your own bulworth rants . just don \\' t expect to be popular with the insurance companies .',\n",

       " ('catherine deane ( jennifer lopez ) is a psychologist who has been hired to participate in a project where she can enter the minds of comatose victims and try to interact with their subconscious in an attempt to wake them up . she has been experiencing moderate success with a young boy in a coma , but the boy \\' s parents aren \\' t happy with the apparent lack of progress and the toll of her job is having adverse affects on her regular life . as if trying to assure the boy \\' s parents wasn \\' t hard enough on her , a new development arises that furthers the strain on deane \\' s mental faculties . a vicious serial killer named carl stargher ( vincent d \\' onofrio ) has been kidnapping women , locking them in an automated cell that drowns them slowly in a matter of days , then soaking the corpses in bleach to turn them into life - sized dolls . just after kidnapping his latest victim and locking her in the cell , stargher has a traumatic experience that triggers a schizophrenic virus in his brain and causes him to sink in an eternal catatonia . the police , led by fbi agent peter novak ( vince vaughn ) are able to locate stargher by some clues he left while dumping his previous victim \\' s body , but they feel all hope is lost for his current victim due to his vegetative state . in a last ditch attempt , they ask deane and the scientists that created the project to undergo the frightening task of entering stargher \\' s mind to try and find the location of the victim locked in the deadly cell . . . a cell which will completely fill with water in the next 40 hours ! initial reports about this film described it as a cross between the silence of the lambs and the matrix . while it does share some characteristics with both films ( particularly the first forty minutes , which seem almost like a condensed version of lambs ) , the cell also seems to contain elements of dreamscape and brainstorm . the buzz around this project is that first - time feature film director tarsem singh ( who won many awards for his video of r . e . m . \\' s \" losing my religion \" ) wanted a script that he could fashion images out of instead of a cohesive story , and a good portion of this film supports that theory . despite the borrowed elements from the aforementioned films and a script that contains several logically questionable moments , the cell does feature some remarkable imagery . all of the sequences where we delve into someone \\' s mind are incredibly beautiful ( including the dank mind of stargher , whose thoughts are reminiscent of an h . r . giger painting come to life mixed with a tool music video ) , proving that singh is as adept at filming strange and wonderful images as his acclaim would lead us to believe . the first sequence that takes place in stargher \\' s mind is by far the best , featuring one of the most ingenious traps i \\' ve ever seen in a film ( involving a horse , which no one seeing this film will probably forget ) , a zoo - like display of stargher \\' s victims which are animated like marionettes , and stargher himself in a giant purple cape that spans the walls of his mental throne room . if the film had continued within this dirty monstrous world i would have deemed the film brilliant , but alas , the sequences only become more silly as they go along ( despite a painful nipple ring removal later in the film ) . the cast is basically just an excuse for there to be some moderate plot semblance during the parade of images , but at least vincent d \\' onofrio turns in his usual bizarre and psychotic performance ( magnified by ten , thanks to the environment in which the film has been placed ) . in my opinion , d \\' onofrio was one of the best creepy actors i have ever seen in a film , but his film choices as of late have been so completely awful ( i . e . - the newton boys , feeling minnesota , the thirteenth floor , and the velocity of gary ) that i have begun to rethink my initial assessment of him . the character of stargher is an excellent role for him though , and will probably lead to a bit of typecasting for him . detractors of violence and disturbing images will want to stay far away from this film , as it contains heavy doses of both . besides the nipple ring removal i mention above , there is also stargher \\' s penchant for hanging suspended off of the floor by the rings that pierce his back and legs ( prior to his catatonia and capture ) which will have audiences recoiling . a sequence where catherine enters stargher \\' s mind and finds him recreating the disemboweling of his first victim is also pretty disquieting . one moment also features a character having his intestines slowly removed from his body by an old fashioned hand cranked spit - like device . as a narrative film , the cell is sorely lacking . as a collection of images though , the cell is extremely well done . although the latter sequences in the film contain fewer disturbing imagery than the first half , singh has done what he supposedly set out to do : make a film solely for the purpose of stringing some remarkable images together . unfortunately , a well - written script should have been considered too , because without it the cell just seems like any other music video we could see on mtv ( provided , of course , that mtv allowed for the use of graphic violence and language in music videos ) .',\n",

       " (\"it ' s been hours since i returned from the much anticipated sci - fi opus ` mission to mars ' , and i can still detect the reek of moldy cheddar . why ? the movie is a shoddy cheesefest full of digital eye candy , stapled carelessly onto a flimsy screenplay which somehow manages to leapfrog the great promise of a space opera , instead shooting for the angle of a feel - good science fiction drama more akin to ` 2001 : a space odyssey ' . i got the feeling that most of my fellow movie - going patrons were expecting another ` armageddon ' . but no , ` mission to mars ' certainly isn ' t one large action sequence about colossal disaster . this is a supposedly thoughtful , family - friendly space flick in which the apocalyptic excitement takes a back seat to visual elegance and uplifting drivel . you have been warned . of course , crafting a tightly claustrophobic space drama is not impossible ( see ` apollo 13 ' for an excellent example ) , but few directors possess the skill and craftsmanship to pull it off without seriously scarring their reputation . brian de palma has enough directorial expertise and visual wizardry up his sleeve to pull it off . when he gets his hands on an intelligent , systematically practical script like ` the untouchables ' or ` mission : impossible ' , the director has the ability to create a sound technical achievement ( although his overly indulgent style becomes bothersome more than occasionally ) . of course , there ' s also the inexcusable string of crap that has carried his name ( including ` snake eyes ' and the notorious bomb ` the bonfire of the vanities ' ) . . . . all of which makes me want to call de palma the most talented hack in hollywood . that term may be too harsh , but if i were judging him solely on the perpetual waste of talent that is ` mission to mars ' , my choice of words would have been slightly less lenient . if i were gary sinise , i wouldn ' t touch de palma with a 10 - foot pole . sinise is a wonderful , wonderful actor , but after appearing in ` snake eyes ' and this vomit - inducing sham , i ' m sure he wouldn ' t want to risk the embarrassment of a third collaboration . the academy award - winner plays nasa astronaut jim mcconnell , a man who recently lost his wife ( kim delaney ) and is apparently psychologically unfit for an upcoming space shuttle mission to mars ( oops , forgot to mention the year - 2020 ) . after a barbecue get - together for the astronauts , we cut to luc goddard ( don cheadle ) and his team , who are already taking measurements and calculations on the red planet . suddenly , a towering formation of rocks and soil - probably best dubbed a ` sand tornado ' - appears and creates a whirlwind of suction . for some reason , the astronauts just stand there calmly to admire this , as if it were a lovely piece of art . the team is killed within seconds , expect for luc , who was able to send one final transmission and may still be alive . immediately , a second mission - consisting of astronauts mcconnell , husband and wife woody and terri blake ( tim robbins and connie nielsen ) and phil ohlmyer ( jerry o ' connell ) - are dispatched to rescue luc and discover the mysterious secret of planet mars . let ' s put the ` secret ' on hold for now , and discuss the trip there . it is explained , whether scientifically accurate or not ( probably not ) , that a trip to mars takes roughly six months . i ' m not sure why the quartet of screenwriters behind ` m2m ' didn ' t capitalize on this juicy opportunity of creating tension and claustrophobia . instead , we join the team during their final days aboard the ship . what happened during the five months prior to this ? did they just play cards and tell dirty jokes ? still , there are few nicely tense moments ( maybe the only in the movie ) during the time - frame involving a fuel leak . depalma ' s direction is quite good in these scenes , although the score by ennio morricone is largely inconsistent ( organ music in space ? c ' mon ) . there ' s a few good , imaginative ideas in the landslide of cheese , a sad realization that causes me to sigh out loud . it ' s a colossal bummer that ` mission to mars ' is poorly assembled and laughably written , with a dubious and supremely silly finale that will only satisfy dedicated optimists . as mentioned before , anyone looking for some disaster - movie carnage is going to feel savagely disappointed . . . maybe even cheated . after the unbelievably hokey final shot ( with the words ? the end ' somehow adding insult to injury ) , a few audience members made the effort to boo and hiss at the screen . others muttered obscenities , shaking their heads in disbelief while mumbling ` jeez , that sucked . ' okay , it did suck . but you have to show the actors some sympathetic mercy . . . after all , they do pretty well . sinise is sincere and effective in many of his scenes , robbins and nielsen wholeheartedly convince as a loving nasa couple , and funnyman o ' connell - well , he has a couple lines are actually amusing ( and intentionally so ) . the digital effects accompanying the sand tornado sequence are quite impressive . so , by golly , where did this ` mission ' go wrong ? looking back on the appalling experience , i would say in practically every conduit and crevasse it could have . while watching ` mission to mars ' , my suggestion would be to immediately abort , or better yet , don ' t even strap yourself in for lift - off .\",\n",

well , so was i . drunken master ii is about a young man named wong fei - hong ( played by jackie chan ) who is a master of the drunken boxing style of kung fu . where he learned this style is uncertain , as his father , wong kei - ying ( ti lung ) is steadfast in his opposition to fei - hong \\' s practicing it rather than some more normal style of kung fu . apparently , fei - hong is some sort of figure from chinese folklore , rather like paul bunyan is for americans , but i \\' ve heard very little about this , and could quite well be wrong , so i \\' ll leave analysis of that to the people who know it better . one of my friends points out that the character of wong fei - hong is also featured in the \" once upon a time in china \" movies , but i have not yet seen those . the plot of drunken master ii is somewhat hazy , as are the plots to many such films , but if you \\' re watching a jackie chan film , odds are you aren \\' t expecting something on the order of \" war and peace \" . the story seems to revolve around those evil foreigners who are spiriting away ancient chinese relics ( and hence , china \\' s cultural heritage ) while overworking , underpaying , and beating up chinese workers in a nearby steel mill . however , this plot merely serves as a framework for the other main story of the film -- fei - hong \\' s perpetual struggle to win his girlfriend , supplicate his father , keep his ( pregnant ) mother ( played by anita mui ) from fighting , and keep from getting beaten up by evil foreigner thugs . the macguffin that drives the plot ( s ) is a precious antique jade imperial seal which is being taken away by the evil foreigners . in the beginning , fei - hong accidentally steals it while trying to recover an identically - wrapped box containing the medicinal ginseng his father was bringing back for a customer . in the process , he clashes with another thief , who is himself trying for the seal but ends up instead with the ginseng . after fei - hong narrowly avoids getting caught with the seal by the evil foreigners \\' lackies , thanks to some timely intervention by a general \\' s son ( a cameo appearance by andy lau , who would later take on the starring role in drunken master iii ! ) , comedic chaos ensues back at the wong household when fei - hong and his mother attempt to come up with a replacement for the missing ginseng . and so it goes . and the plot thickens later on , such as when fei - hong \\' s girlfriend maneuvers him into a kung fu match with a rival , or when fei - hong and the thief , now revealed to be a loyalist manchu officer trying to recover the seal and stop the evil foreigners , are attacked en masse ( another grand kung - fu movie tradition ) , but i think i \\' ve already spent more time on the plot than it really deserves . let \\' s move on to the real draw of jackie chan movies . . . the action . there \\' s plenty of martial arts action to be found in this movie . . . of course , in a kung fu film , that \\' s to be expected . however , this isn \\' t just another kung fu movie ; this one has jackie chan doing the fight and stunt choreography , and jackie chan is a genius . the primary martial arts \" style \" featured in the film is drunken boxing , a form of kung fu which attempts to draw the adversary off his guard by making it seem like the fellow using it is drunk . further , for the purposes of this film at least , drunken boxers fight better when they actually _are_ intoxicated . . . but there \\' s a fine line between just drunk enough and drunk into a stupor . under normal circumstances , the idea of someone staggering around looking sloshed but managing to fight effectively and even incredibly might seem rather stupid , but jackie pulls it off with flair . the kung fu sequences are so intricate in their staging and execution that it is pointless to try to describe it on paper , so i \\' ll just say that the fights -- especially the big climactic fight at the end -- in themselves make the movie worth watching . another thing drunken master ii has going for it is the stunt work . even without motor vehicles ( well , not counting a train ) , there are some remarkable stunts in this film . among other things , jackie dives off a balcony into a table and crawls across hot coals ( not once , but at _least_ twice , if you count the outtake shown during the credits ) . ( quicktime movies of these stunts can be found through the www movie database . ) unlike in american films , these stunts are _not_ faked . drunken master ii stars several veteran actors of the hong kong movie scene , including jackie , ti lung ( \" a better tomorrow \" 1 & 2 ) , and anita mui ( the \" heroic trio \" series , \" rumble in the bronx \" ) . the performances are first - rate , especially when it comes to the comedy parts of the film . the scene where fei - hong and his mother conspire literally behind fei - hong \\' s father \\' s back to cover up for the missing ginseng root is hilarious , as is the scene where fei - hong \\' s mother , having just revealed that she is pregnant , is threatening to hurt herself ( in order to draw her husband \\' s anger away from fei - hong ) . jackie has developed his knack for physical comedy into a sort of mastery over the years , and he \\' s in fine form all through drunken master ii . as far as cinematography is concerned , it certainly works for this film . it \\' s nothing spectacular , but is at least a dozen times better than all those old kung fu movies of the 70s . the picture is crisp and clear . one thing i find particularly worthy of mention is that , at least in the copy i have , the screen was wider than any film i \\' ve ever seen on videotape before -- almost a whole 1 / 3 of the screen was blocked out above and below . ( watch this on a bigscreen tv or movie theater if you can . ) it will be an utter shame if this film is eventually pan - and - scanned for american video release . drunken master ii shows the full potential of \" period piece \" kung fu movies , and it \\' s good enough to overcome even my usual distaste for such movies . the plot does meander a bit , but that \\' s to be expected in this type of film . if you like this kind of movie , you \\' ll love this movie , and if not , well , give it a chance anyway . if nothing else , the martial arts and stunt sequences are by themselves worth the price of admission or rental .',\n",

       " ('note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . be forewarned . \" quick , robin ! the anti - shark repellant ! \" - adam west in the 1966 batman feature film , casually kicking at a pathetic - looking rubber shark attached to his leg i had never thought that an entry in the modern incarnation of the batman feature film would approach this level of campiness , but in many instances batman and robin nears , and at some point even exceeds this standard . this is a disasterously bad film , easily the worst in the series to date , and fairly epitomizes a cinematic definition of the word excessive - it \\' s loud , garish , and obnoxious , with pointless , gratuitous action sequences and set pieces which clutter up the screen with elaborate production design to the point of overkill . batman and robin features the caped crusaders ( george clooney debuting as batman , with chris o \\' donnell returing as robin ) squaring off against another bevy of chemically - induced villains - the nefarious ice - cold mr . freeze ( arnold schwarzenegger ) , armed with a weapon which freezes everything in its sights , and the slinky poison ivy ( uma thurman ) , who has the ability to blow powerful love dust into the faces of men in order so that they will fall helplessly in love with her ( not that the dust is really necessary to accomplish this result , but whatever ) , and then dispatch them with a poisoned kiss . by ivy \\' s side is the giant steroid monster bane ( jeep swanson ) , a grunting hulk of a beast . the villains \\' goals are noble ones - freeze steals diamonds to power his climate suit ( in order to keep his body temperature at zero degrees ) , so that he can survive in order to devise a cure for his beloved wife ( vendela ) , dying of a degenerative disease and frozen in suspended animation , and ivy \\' s intent is to restore the dominance of plant life on earth , albeit by destroying all human life . meanwhile , on the homefront , life at wayne manor is thrown into upheaval by the illness of butler alfred pennyworth ( michael gough ) , and the arrival of his niece barbara ( alicia silverstone ) . akiva goldsman \\' s screenplay for the film is ridiculous and laughably bad , with astonishingly terrible dialogue , lame jokes , and an awful by - the - number plot which simply coasts along and fails to generate any genuine excitement . it makes goldsman \\' s screenplay of batman forever , which i thought was dreadful , look positively inspired in comparison . i am still astonished that a cheesy plot device which i \\' d seen used in - no joke - an episode of gilligan \\' s island somehow make its way into a multimillion dollar blockbuster production . joel schumacher \\' s direction of batman and robin is horrific , with a terrible balance of flashiness over substance . there is a clear conceit towards neon in this film , even moreso than with his previous batman forever , with the revamped batcave helpfully sporting gigantic glowing emblems for the dynamic duo ( just in case , i suppose , if they ever happen to forget that the batcave is the headquarters of batman and robin ) , and with neon prominently figuring in an utterly - pointless fight sequence with bane and a street gang over ivy \\' s chosen new abode . another action sequence which fails to serve any useful point other than to chew up five minutes of screentime involves an incredibly uninvolving late - night motorcycle race with barbara and some gotham goons . mr . schumacher \\' s focus for batman and robin appears to be to make the film as visually striking as possible , to the detriment of the story - there are drastic shifts in the tone of the film between all - out camp and heartfelt drama , with the latter completely unconvincing and ineffective . it is perhaps not the most promising of signs when the group i was with burst out laughing within twenty seconds of the film \\' s opening , even before a single line of dialogue had been uttered . is batman and robin supposed to be campy ? i think it is - it \\' s hard to imagine that the filmmakers could have intended many parts of the film to be taken at all seriously . ( one of my favourites was when bane helpfully grunted \" bomb ! \" each time he laid down an explosive device in the gotham observatory . ) is it supposed to be as overly campy as it turned out to be ? i somehow doubt it - the subplot involving afred is delivered so solemnly and with such graveness that the impression is made that the film isn \\' t attempting to be the utter farce which it is . arnold schwarzenegger is top - billed in the film as the villainous mr . freeze , and is bland and uninteresting , perhaps the worst thing that a villain can be . mr . schwarzenegger \\' s attempts to be menacing are laughable , and his attempts at conveying pathos are laughable ; frankly , everything he does onscreen is laughable . by the end of the film , i was stifling a chuckle every time he simply appeared onscreen . the bulk of his performance consists of uttering near - unintelligble puns and one - liners featuring every possible permutation of \" cool ! \" in the least inventive way . george clooney has been given very little to do in batman and robin , being overshadowed by the villains , and consequently he looks rather uncomfortable in the film . his batman is hardly an imposing figure . chris o \\' donnell is unimpressive in a one - note performance , while alicia silverstone lackadasically fails to make any impression at all . the film \\' s one saving grace ? undoubtably uma thurman \\' s entertaining performance as sexy villainess poison ivy . her work in batman and robin is certainly over - the - top , but in a controlled fashion which works splendidly within the tone of the film . ms . thurman \\' s comic timing is impeccable , and reminds us that it takes skilled performers to make campiness work successfully . ( i \\' m already starting to positively reassess jim carrey \\' s performance in batman forever . ) her amusing poison ivy is the most entertaining character in the film , and when she \\' s offscreen the film greatly suffers . i figure that if one has to die , being kissed to death by uma thurman isn \\' t a half - bad way to go . while batman and robin was hardly a ride of pulse - pounding excitement , i must admit that i was not bored watching it , although i did glance at my watch repeatedly through the screening - my attention was kept through anticipation of the utterance of yet another terrible pun or one - liner , and by awaiting yet another scene to fall flat . it \\' s been a long time since i \\' ve laughed so much at a movie . \" at \" , of course , is the operative word .',\n",

       " ('i wish i could say that there is something more to the new star wars installment than what you see in the commercials , but there isn \\' t . george lucas is an expert at crafting triumphant , special effects - bound flicks and he has done it again . this is the first star wars film i \\' ve seen on the big screen , so , of course , the impact was much greater than when i watched the three original episodes on video . what is compelling about the phantom menace is not its disposable story , but its amazing visuals . basically , the film \\' s plot is centered around trade disputes between two planets . qui - gon ( liam neeson ) and his young apprentice obi - wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) set out with the animated jar - jar binks to fix the mess that may result in war . when their ship breaks down and they are stranded , they find a young boy , anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) and his slave mother . qui - gon strongly believes that anakin is destined for jedi greatness and immediately takes him under his wing . anakin participates in a heart - pounding podrace , one of the highlights of the film , to get the equipment needed to fix qui - gon \\' s ship . however , most everyone is doubtful about entrusting the future to some unknown slave boy . meanwhile , queen amadala ( natalie portman ) is frustrated and at wit \\' s end , being na ? ve and young and having so much responsibility on her shoulders . there are hardly any emotional scenes in the film - even when we discover that anakin will be leaving his slave mother behind to begin jedi training , the frenzied excitement of the whole film wears down the poignancy to the size of a crumb . this does not prove that the phantom menace is poorly made for it is brilliantly made . in all the star wars films , human emotions that we , the audience , can identify with are usually nil , but the films are for pure enjoyment , not for uplifting purposes . despite the fun of watching the movie , the phantom menace is not without flaws . for starters , we have the ill - conceived , moronic character jar - jar binks who should be considered a threat to star wars galactic society and to the audience . what a klutz ! george lucas clumsily tried to create a fun character that would be as memorable as , say , yoda , r2 - d2 , or c3 - po , but , alas , his efforts were in vain . secondly ( this may be good or bad , depending on your point of view ) , the movie \\' s atmosphere is so different from the familiar comic - book feel of the previous three star wars installments . this is due , perhaps , to the utter complexity to this movie \\' s plot and the higher level of sophistication of the visual effects used here . the movie seems to be reaching for epic proportions . i can \\' t say much about the acting , though acting has never been what you saw star wars movies for anyway . however , there is absolutely no pizzazz to the performances - they are straightforward and , at times , stale . natalie portman has a great presence , but her turn as queen amadala makes the queen a stoic , unfeeling ? enigma . there is nothing we can hold onto in her performance to make us believe the trade predicament is anything of importance . jake lloyd is the only actor here who has an ounce of evident spunk . despite the inevitable faults , there is so much to enjoy about the movie . the heightened excitement of the final sequences doesn \\' t quite surpass the famous the empire strikes back climactic scenes , but they are amazing and edge - of - your - seat fun in their own rite . the film is a treasure to look at . the visual effects are astonishing 99 . 8 % of the time - the awe - inspiring , mouth - opening , eye - popping sight of the underwater city is nothing short of production design and special effects genius . not since 1997 \\' s the fifth element has there been a film as drenched in visual treats as this one . the production design is reminiscent of the fifth element , the previous star wars movies , kubrick \\' s 2001 , maybe even of fritz lang \\' s classic silent metropolis . however , all the sets are so original . the original star wars movies can \\' t even match the grandeur of this film \\' s visuals and that is a sheer pleasure for the viewer - it gives us hope of even greater things for the upcoming episode . the costumes are remarkable and have jean - paul gaultier written all over them . whether its queen amadala \\' s gigantic wardrobe complete with gold - embroidery and feathers , or the jedis \\' simple brown uniforms , the costume designer has fused talent with outrageousness . the costumes are one of the true delights of watching the movie . as for john williams \\' score , i don \\' t think he \\' s done one as complex or powerful since ? i can \\' t even remember . it is as epic as his schindler \\' s list score and as thrilling and zestful as jaws . it includes the bare bones of his music from the previous three films , but williams has added on , made the music much more intense and moving . what with the overwhelming hoopla that circled this movie , one might come in with high expectations and be disappointed . there is very little to hate in the film : it \\' s a very accomplished and skillfully made flick . it is the best \" fun \" film and the best big - budget film out today , most definitely .',\n",

       " ('logical time travel movies are a near - impossibility . considering that the skeptic \\' s best argument against the possibility of time travel is the idea of altered realities , writing a script that deals with this problem is an imposing task . occasionally , we get a film that does manage it . terry gilliam \\' s \" 12 monkeys \" was one such film . but more frequently , we get films that don \\' t much deal with it at all . there is one question to ask in this case : does the film have other virtues that override the existing logical inconsistencies ? the \" terminator \" films made up for them with exciting action , \" back to the future \" did it with an entertaining story , and the new film \" frequency \" pulls off the trick with a strong package of its own . is \" frequency \" filled with plot holes ? yes . does it matter ? not really . the film opens in october of 1969 . firefighter frank sullivan ( dennis quaid ) puts his life on the line every time he suits up for his job , then goes home to his loving wife julia ( elizabeth mitchell ) and son johnny ( daniel henson ) . the double - pronged story flashes forward to 1999 , where johnny ( now jim caviezel ) is all grown up and working as a police detective . a strange occurrence -- the appearance of aurora borealis over new york city -- allows father and son to communicate through the same ham radio frank used in \\' 69 and that john has found in the present day . though both are initially skeptical of the idea , john eventually takes this opportunity to warn his father against his impending death in a warehouse fire , and he succeeds in saving frank from certain doom . now flooded with memories of a full life with his father alive , john is initially overjoyed , until he discovers that the changes to the timeline have been disastrous : a serial killer that would have died has instead lived to kill seven more women . frank and john now must work together to set things right , with john using the information he has gathered in the future to instruct frank on what to do in the past . the premise of \" frequency \" is unusual , and requires getting over one very important mental hurdle to fully accept : john and frank are the only ones conscious of how the timeline has been changed as a result of their actions . this isn \\' t explained ; you just have to go with it . when frank doesn \\' t die in a fire , john is the only one who remembers it differently , while everyone else remembers it the new way . the concept also runs into problems concerning just how synchronous the two realities -- 1969 and 1999 -- are to each other . sometimes frank \\' s changing the past results in something happening right away in john \\' s world , and sometimes john gets the changes ahead of time . now , the filmmakers might have perfectly good explanations for this , and i could probably come up with something fairly convoluted ( but nevertheless logical ) if i thought about it hard enough ( for example , the reason john gets advance information of the serial killer \\' s murders was because the change had already happened in frank \\' s world , and john is only witnessing the * projection * of that change ) , but explanations aren \\' t really the point . when \" frequency \" gets cooking , it \\' s a riveting little thriller , even if it is confusing . what matters to a film like this is if the plot makes sense in the moment , and \" frequency \" works as long as it keeps moving . the film manages to be engaging despite the logical confusion . director gregory hoblit and screenwriter toby emmerich structure \" frequency \" as good hollywood entertainment , establishing decent , likable characters , making us care for them , and setting up a goal to be reached and a conflict to be resolved . i liked many of the creative touches : the split screens , allowing us to see how the universe is being affected in both realities , and the greater framework of baseball to drive the action forward . it actually uses the 1969 mets - orioles world series ( the one that featured the amazin \\' mets ) to great effect -- frank uses john \\' s advance knowledge of the series outcome to convince his friends to believe him . ( admittedly , this device may only be of interest to a baseball fan like myself . ) i even liked the final scene , which features frank and john both fighting the same man simultaneously in different time periods . some may find this scene blindingly confusing , as the reality shifts start coming fast and furious , but it does make sense if you think about it ( and give the script a lot of leeway ) , and let \\' s face it : it \\' s a darn cool way to end the film . there are enough surprises and plot twists in \" frequency \" to keep you on your toes , and as a result the movie avoids growing stagnant . the other major thing to appreciate about \" frequency \" is the handling of the father - son relationship . quaid and caviezel carry off their parts easily ; it \\' s a rock - solid job from both actors . the relationship is instantly credible because they find the human truth behind the high concept : how would one react to being able to communicate with a dead relative , or with a future descendant ? watching the exchanges between frank and john will give you a pretty good idea of how to answer that question . the credibility of the human relationship is absolutely crucial to the rest of the film ; if we don \\' t believe in the characters , we don \\' t care about the outcome of the thriller plot . here , we do care , because we like the lead actors . i also liked some of the supporting cast members . elizabeth mitchell gets stuck with two thankless roles , playing julia the doting wife * and * mother , but still performs admirably . andre braugher , late of the television show \" homicide : life on the street , \" gives a nice supporting turn as frank \\' s best friend and future colleague of john . he has a lovely scene in a diner in which he tries to explain the situation to julia while frank \\' s world series predictions come true before his very eyes . braugher strikes the perfect facial expression here , simultaneously dismayed and amused . perhaps the only thing i didn \\' t like about \" frequency \" is the overly sentimental coda , during which the camera \\' s focus goes a little too soft and the baseball theme gets carried overboard . but that \\' s only because the film had already earned a poignancy without resorting to cheap tactics . i freely acknowledge that \" frequency \" may best work as a \" guy \" movie , since it focuses on the very male - oriented idea of father - son relationships ( echoes of \" field of dreams \" can be easily heard ) , but the underlying concept is universally applicable . who wouldn \\' t want to speak with a long - dead parent ? or see how their children turn out ? \" tell me about your life , son \" -- excuse me while i mist up . and don \\' t call me a sissy .',\n",

       " ('one of the most blatantly obvious signs that often - acclaimed director sidney lumet \\' s \" gloria , \" a remake of the 1980 john cassavetes film , had absolutely no effect on me occurred when i was driving home from the theatre . suddenly , i realized that since i had stood up from my theatre seat five minutes before , i had not thought once about the film i had just invested nearly two hours of my life in . when a movie is over , aren \\' t we supposed to think about it for a while , and have a conversation about it with the acquaintances we have just watched it with ? i thought so , but , for one , i saw this particular picture by myself , and # 2 , even if i had been with someone there wouldn \\' t have been anything to talk about in the first place . to be sure , \" gloria \" begins with a stirring , rather poignant prologue in which a seven - year - old boy \\' s family is brutally gunned down by mobsters , in search of a disc his father had with incriminating evidence on it . right before the men broke in , of course , his father gave him the disc to escape with . eventually , the boy , named nicky nunez ( jean - luke figueroa ) , is caught by the mobsters , and taken back to their apartment . meanwhile , gloria ( sharon stone ) has just gotten out of prison for a crime she didn \\' t commit and returns to her ex - boyfriend ( jeremy northam ) to recieve the money he promised her for covering up his crime . when he refuses to give it to her , and then hears the group of men talking about killing nicky , she leaves with him in order to save his life , but not before holding the men at gunpoint , stealing all of their money , and forcing them to strip nude . gloria is the type of fast - talking , smart - mouthed new yorker who always seems to get involved with the wrong people , and she never expected to be stuck with a kid , but she has a heart of gold ( don \\' t they always in this type of movie ) and is only trying to protect the boy , whom she quickly begins to form a close bond with . the previous incarnation of \" gloria \" by cassavetes and starring the luminous gena rowlands , remains unseen by me , but was no doubt superior , even though i can \\' t really imagine how this considerably dull story could be transformed into an entertaining one , regardless of the director or stars . there is no doubt in my mind that director lumet has stuck closely to the original , but the film itself is simply lifeless , with only an occasional laugh popping up here and there so that it isn \\' t completely unbearable to watch . i liked , for example , a very funny climactic sequence where gloria is deciding whether to leave the school she has left the boy at , and keeps turning the car around , then driving a little ways , then slamming on the brakes and turning around again . these bright moments , however , appear long and far between , and the majority of the film deals with the budding relationship between nicky and gloria , which is both painfully predictable and by - the - numbers . throughout , my mind was repeatedly asking the question , \" who really cares ? \" as gloria , sharon stone has adopted an over - the - top brooklyn accent that honestly doesn \\' t sound realistic at all . in the beginning , in fact , i was amazed at how amateurish stone \\' s performance was , but as the film progressed she got better . although not one of her better turns , stone does have a comic flare that refuses to be ignored . jean - luke figeroa was fine as nicky and a little more natural than the usual child actors who are so precocious they make you want to gag . all other actors who appeared were considerably wasted , none more than cathy moriarty , an entertaining actress in her own right , who is billed fourth and has all of one scene , as gloria \\' s friend whom she turns to for help . sony , the studio that released \" gloria , \" obviously does not have any faith in the film , and i don \\' t blame them . they declined to screen the picture for critics , which is never a good sign , particularly with the high - profile people involved . although how much money a movie makes does not determine how good it is ( just look at the spectacular \" in dreams , \" which failed to even make the top 10 last week ) , i have a suspicion \" gloria \" is going to vanish from theaters faster than \" ishtar , \" judging from the opening night 7 : 00 p . m . showing i saw it at , where there were about ten to fifteen people present , counting myself . although stone can be an impressive actress ( just watch her in 1995 \\' s \" casino \" or 1996 \\' s \" last dance \" if you don \\' t believe me ) and sidney lumet can be a respectable director , there is no reasoning for why they thought the cliched story of \" gloria \" was worth remaking or , for that matter , why columbia pictures agreed to finance it when they could have been making a picture that actually looked like it might have an inkling of a chance to be successful .',\n",

       " ('in the company of men made a splash at the sundance film festival because , in a year plagued by brothers mcmullen - style , earnestly shallow gen - x angst pictures , it seemed to be actually about something . it angered people , started arguments outside the theater , riled things up . it ignited a spark of excitement in what otherwise has been a disappointing year for independent film . having endured my share of the hype , i waited calmly for men to reach the hinterlands wherein i reside , and then checked in to see what all the fuss was about . does men live up to its press ? well , yes it does . and it may make you think twice before you consider dating anyone your office . for the uninitiated , newcomers aaron eckhart and matt malloy play chad and howard , two corporate drones who are dispatched by their nameless company to a remote branch office for a six week assignment . chad and howard are archetypes , examples of which you can no doubt find in your own place of business . chad is the blond golden boy , genetically engineered for success , the natural charmer who seems to glide effortlessly up the corporate ladder . howard is chad \\' s boss , but he is weaker of will , the clumsy practitioner of office politics who has achieved his position through dogged persistence rather than raw talent . we first meet them awaiting their flight in a drab airport lounge . there chad suggests a scheme worthy of a shakespearean villain : he and howard will find a vulnerable single woman at the branch office , woo her simultaneously , win her love , and then dump her . the reason ? both men have recently been dumped themselves , and chad sees an easy route to revenge against the fairer sex . \" it \\' ll restore a little dignity to our lives , \" he says . howard , helpless against the force of chad \\' s will , agrees to the plan . they quickly spot their prey in the form of christine ( stacy edwards ) , a fragile deaf woman working as a temp . chad moves in for the kill , flashing his golden boy smile , plying christine with lunch , then flowers , then dinner . howard follows suit , though his efforts are in contrast ham - handed and desperate . flattered to have the attention of two eligible men , christine dates them both . you can guess which one she falls for . soon a tragic lovers \\' triangle develops : christine loves chad , chad loves himself , and howard loves christine on the grounds that , since she \\' s handicapped and shy , she just might be wretched and lonely enough to settle for him . adult social interaction never really progresses beyond the level of junior high , does it ? in chad , writer / director labute and actor eckhart have created one of the most chilling monsters ever committed to film - hannibal lector may eat human flesh , but chad is an eater of souls . his evil is as subtle as a viper \\' s , and as easy as his smile . we watch in stunned disbelief as he back - stabs coworkers , humiliates his subordinates , and works his deadly venom into christine \\' s heart . his character would be a joke if he wasn \\' t so chillingly real - all of us have worked with a chad , and some of us may be him . he \\' s the guy who takes your job and then laughs at you for your weakness . if one of his co - workers should happen to go postal and walk into the office with a bag full of handguns , he had best have his escape route clearly in mind . politics is his game , and the modern cubicle - filled office is his playground . men wears the guise of a black comedy , but it functions best as allegory . the most controversial moment in the film happens when chad humiliates a black temp by asking him how badly he wants to succeed in the company , then forces him to prove it in a manner i won \\' t describe . the scene is charged with racism and fraught with peril . could it happen in the real world ? probably not . taken as allegory , however , it is representative of the treatment of the meek by the powerful in all facets of society . maybe it \\' s just the english major in me , but chad , in his motiveless cruelty towards christine and his careful manipulation of howard , can be seen as a symbol of unbridled capitalism , of greed without conscience . the entire film is a metaphor for social darwinism - only the strong will survive . the marvel of labute \\' s multi - layered script is that it can disturb each member of its audience in an entirely different way . but does the film work as entertainment ? its darned funny in spots , particularly in the men \\' s room scenes , which demonstrate the lengths to which guys will go to hold a conversation while engaged in the most basic of bodily functions . it works less well as drama , since by necessity the characters in an allegory tend to be flat ciphers . stacy edwards gives a measured dignity to christine , and succeeds in making us care for her , but by the end of the film we still know nothing about her . likewise , chad and howard are simply the sum of their actions . by the end of the film you \\' ll feel as if you \\' ve met a genuine monster in chad ; perhaps we can also classify men as a horror film . certainly those expecting a conventional hollywood resolution to the story will walk away disappointed . but the picture is often mesmerizing , and the script is a work of fine craftsmanship , which makes it well worth your time . like all good films , it offers a myriad of parallels to the outside world . while watching chad in his moment of triumph , i couldn \\' t help but think that bill gates must have felt the same sort of cold , merciless satisfaction when he finally stuck it to steve jobs . there may be a little bit of chad in all of us , but some of us have taken chad - ness to the level of art .',\n",

       " (\"in tim burton ' s ` sleepy hollow ' , there is a mysterious headless horseman who decapitates residents of the small town of the same name . he rides a beautiful black steed and carries an imposing sword that cauterizes the wound of his victims with an immediate swipe . burton ' s update on washington irving ' s classic tale of ` the legend of sleepy hollow ' offers us the mystery of the horseman , when the screenplay should have merely settled on the aspect of the horror . writer andrew kevin walker ( ` seven ' ) throws in perhaps too healthy a dosage of sherlock holmes , but the visual treatment of the film is absolutely entrancing , as burton offers foggy locales and detailed costumes that are gorgeous and stirring to examine . as ` sleepy hollow ' opens , we ' re greeted with a juicy cameo from martin landau , who won an oscar in burton ' s ` ed wood ' . landau plays a prominent citizen of sleepy hollow , who , on a fateful carriage ride through the forest , is decapitated by an unseen horseback rider . after two more murders haunt the residents of the quaint little town , constable ichabod crane ( johnny depp ) is sent in to investigate . landlord baltus von tassel ( michael gambon ) explains to crane that the heads have been severed from the carcass and mysteriously taken in each separate case , and that they believe the murderer is a dead hessian trooper ( played briefly by a wonderfully jarring christopher walken ) who has risen from the grave after being decapitated in the western woods . crane is not a man of great superstition , and is determined to root out the human culprit with his assortment of gizmos and gadgets ( things i was not surprised to find in a tim burton movie ) . first and foremost , ` sleepy hollow ' is a fun horror film . as with virtually all burton movies , we are treated to a wonderful score by composer danny elfman , who has once again poured excitement and imagination into an atmospheric soundtrack that accentuates the gothic mood perfectly . the horseman f / x are stylish and impressive , particularly in perfectly blended battle sequences involving actual actors . but why did i enjoy ` sleepy hollow ' as much as i did ? although enjoyable , it was not the numerous beheadings and the plentiful gore that spurted left and right . . it was the light comic touch that burton applied . the film has the sweetness of a candy apple , usually channeled through depp ' s wonderful performance as the lovable geek ichabod crane , who is no longer a mild - mannered school teacher but still attains his cowardly qualities . this is certainly not the only alteration that ' s been made . as the film progresses , it becomes apparent that walker is more concerned with the mystery of the murders than the murders themselves . the momentum is slowed considerably once crane begins piecing the mystery together , because for the audience , it ' s not an issue we particularly wish to be solved . it ' s more effective for the headless horseman to be an elusive demon than an elusive demon with an ulterior motive . still , we are still captivated by the breathtaking technical detail and burton ' s keen eye to capture our attention . the costuming is exceptional , and the dialogue is crisp and effective throughout ( it ' s recognizable that the script was refined by award - winning playwright tom stoppard ) . the supporting cast exhibits more color and playfulness than many . a blonde christina ricci is in fine form as von tassel ' s daughter katrina , and an unlikely romance between she and ichabod is surprisingly consistent . walken , michael gough ( who appeared in burton ' s ` batman ' films ) and miranda richardson are all enjoyable in tackling their separate roles . i suppose the strengths behind ` sleepy hollow ' lie within the central trio : director burton , constable depp and the headless horseman who hunts him down with ruthless accuracy . all of this is not to be taken seriously , of course . ` sleepy hollow ' is a lavish , frightening and altogether amusing reworking of a classic tale that many people cherished as children . if you ' ve got a decent head on your shoulders , you ' ll have the good sense to gallop off to the theater and enjoy it one last time .\",\n",

       " ('as we see the terrible events that unfold before our eyes in the middle east at the moment , hollywood doesn \\' t loose the oppertunity to get involved , by telling stories and expressing opinions . this film centers on a relationship forged throughout the adult lifetimes of two marine colonels , hays hodges ( tommy lee jones ) and terry childers ( samuel l . jackson ) . they fought side by side in vietnam , where childers saved hodges \\' life by shooting an unarmed pow . that \\' s against the rules of war but understandable , in this story anyway , under the specific circumstances . certainly hodges is not complaining . years pass . hodges , whose wounds make him unfit for action , gets a law degree and becomes a marine lawyer . childers , is now a respected and much - decorated hero that has served his country with his life and sould . because of his excellent record , childers is sent to yemen to rescue the american ambassador ( ben kingsley ) , cowering in the embassy under assault from violent demonstrators and snipers blasting from rooftops . childers does what he has to do : evacuate the family and protect the men under his command . after three marines die and the colonel thinks he sees ground fire , he orders his troops to shoot into the firing crowd . more than 80 yemeni men , women , and children are mowed down . childers is immediately accused of ordering his men to fire on a crowd and murder of unarmed civilians . he persuades his old friend hodges to represent him in the courtroom drama that occupies the second half of the film . did childers violate authorized u . s . military rules of engagement ? or are there simply no rules in war ? the answers to these stereotypical questions are obvious , but the inconsistent plot immediately raises all sorts of other questions . the murder of 83 \" innocent civilians \" has to result into something greater than a simple trial in the u . s . where is the accusations from the arab leaders ? where is the u . n . ? the film ends without even telling the most interesting story : what happens on the international arena ? this film ( in a way akin to films such as \" a few good men \" ) has already been accused of breaking the rules of morality and ethics and even of racism . these accusations are pretty heavy , but also unfair . what director william friedklin truly broke was the rules of decent filmmaking . one of the earliest apparent problems with \\' rules of engagement \\' is its lack of credibility . the entire operation in yemen may remind us about what happens in the middle east right now , but is overdone , contrived and unrealistic - as if a chain of events had to happen in a particular manner in order for the plot to proceed . a lot of it is so cheesy that no one could possibly accept it as reality . that is precisely why it \\' s not offensive . it is completely unobjective . many stories are started and never finished . many questions are asked , but never answered . a lot of parallels are referring to nothing . it seems that neither the director , producers or the screenwriter can make up their minds about the contents of their film . is it about arab mentality ? america \\' s foreign policies ? america \\' s role in the world ? corruption in the higher circles ? it goes on and on . it consists of countless stories , but not a definable plot . it tries to be everything for everyone and ends up being nothing for no one . i think that it is ironic , because director william friedkin \\' s probably most acclaimed film was \" the exorcist \" which had a silly story , but became a rather effective film . in this case you have a strong story with many possibilities and the result is a silly film . though several scenes bare the mark of professionalism ( such as the impressive battle scenes ) , his latest film does simply not engage . i believe that friedklin is a director that is absolutely depended on great scripts and talented producers in order to succeed . it \\' s obvious that he has neither and the result is therefore a catastrophe . the characters feel designed , unreal , merely shadows , with no life outside the conflict . even the actors can not save this film from going under . though both jackson and jones act admirably , with performances that are as good as you get with a script like this , it is not something that these great actors can boast of . they have roles that they could play blindfolded with their hand on the back . jackson is gray and jones uninteresting . the rest of the cast , including ben kingsly , blair underwood and guy pearce are simply waiting for their paychecks . the time has come for the verdict . on the charges of complete lack of objectivity , i find this film guilty . on the charges of breaking the rules of reasonable filmmaking , i find it guilty . but on the charges of racism i find this film not guilty , because of it \\' s inconclusive and often silly plot that lacks objectivity everywhere , not only when concerning the arab population . i must admit that the film is dangerously near the line of being racially offensive and i do think that screenwriter stephen gaghan went a bit too far , portraying the yemeni people almost as stereotypical hollywood bad - guys . this is very sad , since in a time like this it is crucial to not lose objectivity and proclaim the truth . however , it is absolutely necessary to remember that the muslim terrorists are responsible for most of the terrorist activity in and outside the united states . and that it \\' s not a coincidence that u . s . residents in the middle east , including yemen are on constant maximum alert .',\n",

       " ('the realm of science fiction has always been an allegory of political and or moral sensibilities . the best tales of the genre deal with mankind \\' s struggle for survival or knowledge . such popular and noteworthy tomes as \" stranger in a strange land \" by robert heinlein , \" childhood \\' s end \" by arthur c . clarke and \" man in the high castle \" and \" do androids dream of electric sheep \" by philip k . dick all deal with man \\' s need for identity and struggle for self worth . hollywood has regularly adapted the milieu ( if not the message ) of science fiction since it \\' s beginnings . most films just created fancy pulp tales with no more thought that the escapism they achieved . it really wasn \\' t until producer george pal , took charge of robert heinlein \\' s novel \" rocketship galileo \" and crafted the film \" destination moon \" , that \\' sci - fi \\' ( as it is commonly referred to ) , came into it \\' s own . from there , such diverse filmmakers as roger corman to stanley kubrick , have sought to express ideas through the medium of the genre . with the release of touchstone pictures \" mission to mars \" , we have an unabashedly nonchalant sci - fi film for those who read the national enquirer and the globe . the film opens on a summer barbecue , as phil ohlmyer ( jerry o \\' connell ) woos a young female with his tales of space glory and the upcoming mission . woody blake ( tim robbins ) and his wife terri ( connie nielsen ) commit to his coming authority on the mission , and luc goddard ( don cheadle ) consoles his son . entering the party is jim mcconnell ( gary sinise ) , who gave up command of the mission due to the untimely death of his wife , maggie ( kim delaney ) . luc consoles jim with woody \\' s assistance . the three men are friends and carry a fine bond of trust and caring between them . but jim still longs to set foot on the red planet . the mission is in earnest as luc and his team land in the cydonia region of mars . they send out the rover to investigate the area and discover what seems to be water or ice under the surface . going out to investigate , luc and his team approach the famed \\' face on mars \\' . a strange noise emanates from the rock . as the team tries to scan through the rock with radar , a violent wind storm erupts , creating a vortex that kills all members of the team , save for luc . back on the space station orbiting earth , woody and jim receive the information that the mars landing team is missing . luc \\' s interference laden emergency message urges the two men to attempt a second mission to the red planet in the hopes of rescuing the previous team . the second journey to the martian world is fraught with danger . meteorite showers , explosions , and rescues all come into play as the intrepid heroes make there way to the planet \\' s surface . the big question is , is there now or has there ever been intelligent life on mars . and if so , what is its relationship with us ? now for the bad news . the entire plot of \" mission to mars \" is based almost wholeheartedly on outdated and preposterous national enquirer type martian civilization tripe . the famed \\' face on mars \\' becomes the centerpiece of the film , revealing some of the most harebrained sci - fi pabulum the screen has witnessed . borrowing ideas from such films as \" robinson crusoe on mars \" ( 1964 ) , quatermass and the pit ( 1967 ) , \" 2001 : a space odyssey \" , and even mario bava \\' s \" planet of the vampires \" ( \\' terrore nello spazio \\' ) ( 1965 ) , \" mission to mars \" is a hodgepodge of ideas that don \\' t add up to a satisfying whole . while some sequences are wonderfully handled and executed , the film remains flat and un - involving . so much time is giving to establishing the lead characters in the film , but to no good use . the performances are all workmen like , with only don cheadle ( as luc ) carrying any sort of real chemistry . gary sinise is wasted in role that requires him to look as if he is experiencing sleep depravation . and the mistaken idea of having jerry o \\' connell ( as phil ohlmyer ) play his part for comic relief is just too painful to excuse . and the less said about tim robbins called in from home performance the better . he \\' s just having too much fun here to give a damn . the script has a few lapses , namely that after discovering several breaches in the hull of the ship caused by a meteorite shower , no one thinks of checking the fuel tanks or the remainder of the ship for damage . this of course leads to our heroes having to abandon their rescue ship . also , when one character sacrifices himself , the character takes on a religious demeanor that is completely at odds with the situation . but the biggest offence in the film is the horrid , intrusive score by ennio morricone . subtlety is non - existent here . in fact in some scenes the music becomes so extravagant that dialogue is almost drowned out . the only sequence in which the score almost works is during the protracted meteorite shower . the pacing of the film is very leisurely . after the opening introduction of the characters ( which lasts a full 22 minutes ) , we are finally dropped onto the martian surface . then , there is another long pause in the plot for more character development , including an elaborate dance sequence in zero gravity . the film could lose about 30 minutes and actually gain some momentum . there are so many scenes of talking heads , discussing what we already know is going to happen , that it drags the film to a dead stop . the good news is that the film is absolutely sumptuous to look at . the vistas of the planet mars are majestic and awe inspiring . the design of the numerous spacecraft and suits are all expertly drafted , with a level of realism that hasn \\' t been seen since \" 2001 : a space odyssey \" . the visual effects are just stunning , from the space walk sequences , to the visualization of evolution on earth . the only fault come with the martians themselves , which look more like something out of a plastic model kit than something from another world . director de palma stages some wonderfully creative scenes through out the film . the opening sequence alone in a seemingly un - interrupted cut lasting almost 15 minutes ( an homage \\' to hitchcock \\' s \" rope \" ) , as we are introduced to all of the characters . scenes in the rescue ship , with its rotating centrifuge , are just amazing in their execution . but the nagging question , is the final explanation worth all of this sturm und drang . sadly it is not . director brian de palma has crafted an extravagant production . the set design and visual effects are all arresting . but it \\' s the comic strip denouncement that ruin what might have been a fine return to good adventurous , thought provoking science fiction . a disappointing film , but one that might still entertain if you can settle for the visuals .',\n",

       " ('some critics , including siskel & ebert , are on the record stating that martin scorsese \\' s raging bull , the story of boxer jake la motta , is the best film of the \\' 80s . since there are still a number of \\' 80s films that i haven \\' t seen , i don \\' t feel qualified to make such a judgment , but i \\' ll say this without hesitation : raging bull is a great motion picture , and i would be surprised if more than a handful of films released between january 1 , 1980 and december 31 , 1989 come close to its level . bio - pics often fall into one of two categories : overblown hero - worship or a dry , dull textbook account . it \\' s rare that a movie with the moniker \" based on the life of ? \" comes across as anything more than sporadically energetic and marginally entertaining . raging bull is the perfect counterexample , and a brilliant argument for film makers to continue to work in this genre . the picture takes the life of boxer jake la motta , a middleweight icon from the \\' 40s and \\' 50s , and develops one of the most compelling character studies ever to reach the big screen . for all 129 minutes , director martin scorsese and actor robert de niro ( in the title role ) have us mesmerized by this individual who is by turns sympathetic , sad , and horrifying . historically , raging bull is said to be mostly accurately , with the lion \\' s share of the details culled from la motta \\' s own autobiography ( which was co - written with joseph carter and peter savage ) . however , although la motta is credited as the movie \\' s \" consultant , \" he was reportedly unhappy with the final result , because it portrays him as nothing short of an uncouth , insensitive lout . the la motta of the movie is a man of extreme appetites who is driven by base , bestial impulses ? paranoia , jealousy , and blind rage . sex and violence are inextricably linked . the title is apt ? la motta is a raging bull . in the ring , he is a terror , not just beating his opponents , but destroying them . outside of it , he is no less vicious or more easily controlled . the two people who spar with him on life \\' s canvas are his wife , vicki ( cathy moriarty ) , and his brother / manager , joey ( joe pesci ) . these are the two who mean the most to jake , and who , as a result of his inability to trust himself or others , he loses . he beats vicki mercilessly because he suspects her of infidelity , and , when he inaccurately believes that his brother betrayed him , his lets loose with an explosion of violence . raging bull opens in 1941 when la motta , an up - and - coming fighter , is battling his way into the upper echelon of the middleweight class . over the years , he wins several key bouts , including one against his arch - rival , sugar ray robinson ( johnny barnes ) , but his unwillingness to capitulate with the local godfather keeps him from an opportunity to participate in a championship match . meanwhile , away from the ring , la motta falls in love with 15 - year old vicki , who he marries after discarding his shrewish first wife . vicki becomes jake \\' s greatest prize ( a wife , in his view , is not a companion , but a possession ) and the source of his most extreme pain . his own insecurity is so great that he cannot accept that a woman as beautiful as vicki could be faithful to him . hence , he is constantly haunted by a belief that she is sleeping with someone else ? perhaps even his brother . ( this leads to the famous line parodied in waiting for guffman and elsewhere : \" are you f * * king my wife ? ? ? \" ) in the late \\' 40s , la motta gets his first shot at a championship fight , but with one huge condition : he must take a fall . he does it so badly that an investigation is launched and he is almost thrown out of boxing . two years later , he wins the championship , only to lose it in a subsequent bout to sugar ray . by the late \\' 50s and early \\' 60s , when the film ends , jake has become a pathetic figure ? a broke , overweight loser who has spent time in jail for corrupting the morals of a minor , has lost his wife and children , and is trying to earn a few bucks by doing a cheap standup routine . raging bull is the other side of rocky . sylvester stallone \\' s tale of boxing triumph was released to great critical acclaim in 1976 . it won the 1977 best picture oscar , and a sequel arrived in theaters before raging bull went into production . but , where rocky romanticizes boxing , raging bull takes a cold , unflinching look at the violence both inside and outside of the ring . while scorsese \\' s primary aim is to present a riveting deconstruction of la motta the man , he never backs away from showing the seedy , ugly underside of a sport where gambling , greed , and organized crime force fighters to throw matches to continue working . rocky shows boxing at its noblest ; raging bull shows it at its most diseased . there \\' s little i can say here that hasn \\' t already said about de niro \\' s performance . in a career that has included many fine roles , this is his most outstanding . the level of intensity de niro brings to la motta is unwavering . and , although there \\' s a lot of travis bickle ( de niro \\' s character in taxi driver ) in la motta , scorsese and de niro go to great lengths to make sure that , if we never fully sympathize with him , at least we understand the forces that drive him . this is a complete characterization and a perfect example of acting . as the younger jake , de niro is trim and fit . as the fat , older man , de niro gained 50 pounds and turned his body into a grotesque parody of its normal form . how many actors would go that far ? the best oscar statue is only one testimony to the lasting power of the performance . cathy moriarty and joe pesci both earned nominations for their supporting work ( although neither won ) . their portrayals have the same raw energy that infuses de niro \\' s . pesci , who has basically re - created the same personality in two other scorsese films ( goodfellas and casino ) , presents joey as a slightly more intelligent version of his brother . the misogyny and violence are still there , only better concealed . but , when joey snaps , as he does in one scene where he pounds on a mobster ( frank vincent ) , it \\' s startling to behold . moriarty , on the other hand , must play the temptress with virginal qualities ? the only kind of woman who would ensnare jake . later , she \\' s called upon to portray the battered wife and mother whose love has turned into fear . scorsese and cinematographer michael chapman elected to shoot the bulk of raging bull in black - and - white ( a few \" home movie \" segments are in color ) . the choice is perfect for the movie , giving raging bull a unique look in an era when a black - and - white approach is almost unheard of . ( one important recent exception , schindler \\' s list , eschewed color for some of the same reasons that raging bull did . ) in black - and - white ( especially considering scorsese \\' s choice of shots and use of slow motion ) , the violence is stark and disturbing . there \\' s no room for romanticism in the ring with inky black blood staining the canvas . during fight sequences , the director also uses a number of point - of - view shots designed to show the world , however briefly , from la motta \\' s perspective . scorsese could have chosen to end the film with la motta \\' s loss to sugar ray , where he surrendered his middleweight crown . after that , his career was all downhill . yet the director allows the film to run for thirty minutes after this pivotal moment , stretching more than a decade into la motta \\' s future . the reason is obvious : scorsese isn \\' t as interested in boxing as he is in the character . following his retirement , la motta is still as violent and volatile as ever , but he has lost the arena in which he can legally unleash those tendencies . we see the results of this beast let loose on society and how the consequences of his actions reduce him to a parody of his former self . who cannot feel a surge of pity for la motta as he quietly recites marlon brando \\' s speech from on the waterfront ? ( \" i coulda been a contenda . \" ) perhaps raging bull is indeed the best film of the \\' 80s . and , if not , it \\' s certainly perilously close to the zenith .',\n",

' with these words , we are brought into the world of a sultry vampire seductress by the name of lilith silver ( played by eileen daly ) . made into an immortal a century and a half ago by the sinister ethan blake , she continues to alleviate boredom with her state of being . so , what ' s an undead girl to do , except squeeze into the tightest fitting clothes possible , get out her guns , seduce a few guys , and kill a few people for money and blood ? with that out of the way , let me say this . this film is bad . this film is really , really bad . yet somehow , it is strangely enjoyable . with all the elements of a direct to video horror flick ? buxom babes , gore , cheesy dialogue , and bad acting ? any casual film viewer would be more inclined to spend their money on renting innocent blood or going to see blade . still , it is considered to be one of the finest british vampire film . agreed , it might be , but is far from being the best vampire flick ever . period . razor blade smile has some rather high production values , shown by the nice overall tone to the film . the film is also a bit of a departure from popular vampire lore , with a vampire that can go out in broad daylight without disintegrating , doesn ' t sleep in a coffin ( but leaves one next to her computer ) , and sees religion as the ` opium of the peoples ' ( hence , immunity to crosses ) . but aside from that , it doesn ' t stray too far away from horror film conventions . that is , unless that is intentional . razor blade smile literally goes for the throat , then pumps the wound full of processed cheese . you can ' t help but laugh when a female vampire gets decapitated and her severed head goes flying into a puddle . you ' ll laugh even harder at the hideously contrived situations ( to distract two female guards , lilith tosses a cellular phone towards them and dials the number ) . you ' ll laugh the hardest when a murder witness recants the tale and suddenly starts sobbing uncontrollably . and then , there ' s the sudden twist ending ( i have enough heart not to give it away ) . the film refuses to take itself seriously , which is a good thing , as by the time lilith zips up her skin - tight body suit and then unzips it just to show the right amount of cleavage , you ' ve most likely forgotten the main point of the story . but in case you really care , she ' s been assigned to kill a bunch of people who belong to the so - called illuminati , and she ' s leaving a huge mess behind for the police to find . as much as my criticisms , this movie works best as a guilty pleasure or as a film that you watch with your friends and within groups . almost destined for cult - status , the film ' s campy , cheesy overtones actually work towards the film . while this may not necessarily be the film you ' d want to be seen watching by yourself , it makes for a fun time at the movies .\",\n",

       " ('on re - watching italian writer / director dario argento \\' s much lauded murder mystery tenebrae , i was struck more than anything else by how many sins he commits as a storyteller and manages to get away with . in emphasising style over matters of plot argento is somewhat notorious in cult film circles , but some aficionados still praise tenebrae as the greatest of his \" giallo \" murder mysteries . while it \\' s certainly not perfect , repeated viewings reveal it to be nonetheless a densely plotted and terrifically stylish thriller . the story follows a promotional visit to rome by famous american mystery novelist peter neal ( anthony franciosa ) where he discovers that a serial killer is on the loose inspired by his latest book \" tenebrae \" . with the police on his back for leads , he decides to take a personal interest in the case and he soon becomes drawn into a mystery where all is not as it seems . the film benefits enormously from a fine central performance by franciosa . he brings grace , charm and a deceptive benigness to his character which provides an interesting foil to both the violence of the books he writes and the unfolding real - life horror around him . the film is awash with a fascinating psychosexual tension . argento peels back the facade of showbiz and jetset lifestyles to reveal an amoral , ambivalent , shadowy world where desire in all its forms has become a dangerous business . tenebrae is perhaps the most multi - layered of argento \\' s scripts to date and there is much bubbling underneath the surface here . it may take at least two or three viewings to appreciate all the psychological themes at play . in that respect it strongly recalls his previous giallo deep red / profondo rosso ( the full - length italian language version ) and fans will enjoy spotting the recurring themes . needless to say for argento fans , there is no denying the director \\' s brilliance as a stylist . many of the action and murder sequences are directed with his characteristic finesse and feature plenty of intriguing camerawork . they are all the more impressive for the fact that in this film argento creates mood by filling his scenes with light , rather than the dark shadows and deep rich colours of earlier works like deep red and suspiria . instead , tenebrae \\' s set design and lighting paints a sleek , clinical , chilly vision of a vaguely futuristic urban world . and the soundtrack \\' s mix of electronic atmospheres and gothic rock by frequent argento collaborators goblin is the perfect accompaniment . so tenebrae has much to recommend it , no question . still , constantly nagging at the back of this viewers mind is several lumps in the narrative . some critics argue that logic doesn \\' t matter in argento films , but damnit , it matters in all films to the point where viewers don \\' t deserve to feel cheated . by the way , if you don \\' t want to know the solution to the mystery then skip the next three paragraphs . about an hour into tenebrae the story takes an unexpected twist which , properly handled , could have proved ingenious . we witness the murder of the serial killer himself by a man who , we later discover , is none other than the author peter neal . he is insane , apparently . the murders then continue for the remainder of the film as neal decides it \\' s time to settle some personal business involving his neurotic wife . he is finally revealed to us as this \" second killer \" in the film \\' s bloody climax . but argento muffs the twist , both technically and narratively . you see , we are supposed to be tricked into thinking that during this scene peter neal is actually an innocent witness who was crouching in the bushes nearby the whole time and spying on the killer \\' s house . but thanks to poor editing , its had to believe neal could have murdered the killer anyway . bad cutting puts the timing way out . in other words , he \\' s almost in two places at once . during this crucial scene we are also thrown a ridiculous red herring . by the film \\' s end you realise that for the sake of an alibi neal must have self - inflicted a nasty injury in this earlier scene to make it look like he was attacked by a fleeing assailant . the injury ? he banged himself on the head with a bloody great rock ! thus , the revelation of the \" hero \" as a killer ( and anti - hero ) in the final scenes may still prove shocking , but its all somewhat implausible by the time the end credits have rolled . helpfully , in the end we do learn that the bizarre flashbacks of personal humiliation and murder that have permeated the film belonged to neal all along . but there too is a problem , as the explanations offered for his motivations are psychologically fuzzy to say the least . the story owes us a better understanding of franciosa \\' s mind , his concealed madness and his sudden murderous rampage . tenebrae is also marred by annoying little inconsistencies . for instance , a teenage boy and girl leave a hotel room and minutes later we see the girl riding off on the back of a motorbike . we would assume the rider is the same boy , but it turns out to be some male character we aren \\' t even introduced too ! that \\' s careless filmmaking , pure and simple . why , you may ask , do i go on about the story \\' s flaws ? because when it comes to visuals and set pieces , argento is one of the most exciting filmmakers in the world . take one of the extended scenes in tenebrae . an upset girl wandering the streets at night needlessly taunts a guard dog to the point where - almost unbelievably - it jumps a high fence and chases her across town . finally , as she desperately seeks escape from this crazed canine , she accidentally stumbles on the serial killer \\' s lair . it \\' s an absolutely masterful sequence , tense and exciting , and communicating a wealth of information through visuals alone . and that \\' s exactly the kind of thing that makes the flaws so frustrating . too often , it seems , argento \\' s films as a whole are less than the sum of their impressive parts . mind you , if you love murder mysteries then tenebrae is still worth a look . and if you \\' re a fan of argento \\' s unique style of giallo thriller then it \\' s essential . see the uncut widescreen version if you can and drink in some of the wonderful cinematography by luciano tovoli . it \\' s a stylish , great - looking and quirky film despite the problem narrative . a shame , because it doesn \\' t have to be that way . take argento \\' s more recent stendhal syndrome ( 1992 ) , where with the aid of co - writer franco ferrini he fashioned a solid storyline without sacrificing any of his surreal weirdness or visual panache . proof that he can do it , if he tries . . .',\n",

\" the world in gridlock \\' d is just as frustrating as the world in falling down , but the cathartic moments yield no easy answers this time . hall has some interesting things to say about what we expect from the system , but perhaps not enough of them . a significant chunk of gridlock \\' d is devoted to spoon and stretch \\' s flight from d - reper and from the police , and those sub - plots serve up some thoroughly predictable moments . in one scene , stretch scares off d - reper by getting chummy with a police officer ; another presents that old chestnut of the two mistakenly - suspected heroes in a public place watching a television news report of the crime which shows their pictures . the entire sequence of events seems designed merely as an excuse to get spoon and stretch running , while the other primary plot has them standing in line or sitting down much of the time . hall also plays with gratuitous inserts of drug paraphernalia and flashbacks to the day before the film \\' s main events , perhaps making a particular effort to point out the talent the characters are wasting through self - destructive behavior . oh , the irony of it . tupac shakur made a career in music and movies playing the hard case , and living the life to back it up . in gridlock \\' d , shakur gets the chance to play someone who has seen enough of the way his life could go to know that it scares him . spoon is an idea for a character at best as written by hall , but shakur displays an intelligence and survival instinct which struggle with his addiction . mostly it comes through those eyes , eyes with none of the hardness you might expect from the infamous gangsta . it is spoon who plays conscience to stretch \\' s pure appetite , and roth plays stretch with a gleeful self - destructiveness ( he reveals that he is hiv positive even as he is preparing to shoot up again ) which is as much an obstacle to spoon \\' s goal as any agency or enemy . gridlock \\' d \\' s most cruelly comic scene finds stretch \" helping \" spoon get into an emergency room by repeatedly stabbing him with a tiny pocket knife , and it becomes an appropriate symbol for how the company he keeps has slowly drained the life out of him . with friends like that , spoon doesn \\' t need enemies , and shakur looks at stretch with the tired eyes of a man who has seen too much . the tragedy now is that we won \\' t get more chances to see those eyes again .',\n",

       " ('it has been three long years since quentin tarantino stunned the cinema world by claiming the cannes film festival \\' s palme d \\' or , a $ 100 million - plus box office gross , and an oscar nomination ? all for his sophomore outing , pulp fiction . since then , the talented film maker has been virtually invisible , surfacing briefly as a co - director of the wildly uneven four rooms and the screenwriter of the gory vampire - fest , from dusk till dawn . in between , he has moonlighted as an \" actor \" with several decidedly unmemorable performances . now , with much fanfare and anticipation , tarantino has returned with his third directorial effort , jackie brown . and , while this motion picture , adapted from elmore leonard \\' s novel , rum punch , offers solid entertainment , those expecting another bravura outing from tarantino will leave theaters disappointed . for the most part , jackie brown is a pretty ordinary crime movie . the story , which starts out slowly , develops into a twisty affair , with double - crosses and triple - crosses . and the movie is littered with occasional tarantino trademarks : witty dialogue , unexpected gunfire , \\' 70s pop tunes , and close - ups of womens \\' bare feet . yet , for all of that , the production is something of a letdown . the sheer , in - your - face exuberance that marked reservoir dogs and especially pulp fiction is absent . the mostly - straightforward chronology of jackie brown doesn \\' t match up favorably to the non - linear style of tarantino \\' s previous efforts ? an approach that added tension and edginess to the narratives . and there aren \\' t nearly as many deliciously offbeat conversations this time around . there \\' s a samuel l . jackson monologue about guns , a jackson / chris tucker argument regarding the merits of hiding in a car trunk , and a jackson / robert de niro exchange that recalls some of the jackson / travolta material from pulp fiction , but that \\' s about it . jackie brown \\' s lone \" innovation \" is its presentation of a crucial sequence from three different perspectives . this isn \\' t exactly an original technique ? it has been done numerous times before , most famously in akira kurosawa \\' s rashomon and most recently in edward zwick \\' s courage under fire . however , while in those two movies ( and others ) , there was a legitimate plot reason for the multiple points - of - view , tarantino \\' s sole purpose for using it appears to be because it \\' s unconventional . had the scenes in question been shown from only one of the three vantages , nothing would have been lost . as a result , this aspect of the film is little more than a curiosity . for the second picture in a row , tarantino is attempting to revive the career of a \\' 70s icon . this time around , instead of john travolta , it \\' s blaxploitation queen pam grier ( foxy brown has become jackie brown ) . in one of many nods to the most famous segment of grier \\' s career , tarantino uses a \\' 70s song to accompany her first appearance during the opening credits . there are also several instances during jackie brown when the director offers a sly wink towards certain conventions of the blaxploitation genre ( although grier never does any butt - kicking ) . grier is jackie brown , a flight attendant who gets caught transporting drugs and money into the united states . she \\' s working for gun dealer ordell robbie ( samuel l . jackson ) , but she keeps her mouth shut under questioning , despite pressure from ray nicolet ( michael keaton ) , a federal official . no longer sure whether or not he can trust jackie , ordell arranges for a bail bondsman , max cherry ( robert forster , tv \\' s \" banyon \" ) to post the necessary $ 10 , 000 , then plans to shoot jackie if she proves disloyal . jackie passes ordell \\' s test , however , and soon the two of them are plotting a way to smuggle $ 500 , 000 of ordell \\' s money into the united states without tipping off the feds . soon , just about everyone is after that money , including jackie , max , ray , ordell \\' s perpetually oversexed and drugged - out girlfriend , melanie ( bridget fonda ) , and his right - hand man , louis ( robert de niro ) . unsurprisingly , the most memorable performance is turned in by samuel l . jackson , but ordell isn \\' t nearly as invigorating or compelling a character as jules from pulp fiction . in addition to looking fantastic , pam grier is also quite good , although hers is not an oscar - caliber performance ( although she might get a nomination ) . robert forster and michael keaton are solid in their tough - guys - who - rarely - smile roles . bridget fonda is around for three discernible reasons : to look sexy in a bikini , to provide a little twisted comedy , and to satisfy tarantino \\' s foot fetish . robert de niro is criminally underused in a part that could have been played equally well by any grungy - looking , middle - aged actor . the film , which clocks in at several minutes over the two - and - a - half hour mark , is probably too long for the material , but the plot is convoluted enough to keep us guessing throughout ( although the payoff is a letdown ) . tarantino keeps things moving along nicely , with a heavier dose of humor and less violence than in pulp fiction , but , on the whole , this movie seems more like the work of one of his wannabes than something from the director himself . when it comes to recent caper films ( like the grifters and bound ) , jackie brown is a second - tier effort . it \\' s an entertaining diversion , but not a masterpiece , and certainly not an oscar contender .',\n",

( at least i hope there aren ' t 10 worse films than this . ) and i know i wasn ' t the only one who really disliked this movie . as the audience was filing out of the screening , i loitered in the theater lobby to catch a few comments . the general consensus seemed to be that , although the movie sucked , the promotional key ring was cool . the problem is that fox won ' t be giving out key rings to regular movie - goers , so that nixes any reason to see firestorm .\",\n",

guilty verdict , despite an emotional testimony from the victim ( heather matarazzo ) . he leaves the courthouse with his lovely wife mary ann ( charlize theron ) where he is approached with an offer to travel to new york city to help choose a good jury . he accepts ( mainly after seeing the paycheck he will receive ) and he flies to new york with his wife . after proving his worth for selecting juries ( and his perfect winning streak in court ) , the head of the firm , john milton ( al pacino ) , asks him to work permanently as a criminal lawyer . he graciously accepts , where he is treated almost as a god . he is given an incredible apartment ( which is bigger than my entire house now ) , and a hefty paycheck . his life seems to be on the rise . and of course , his life suddenly begins to waver and slowly decline . he is attracted to fellow employee christabella ( connie nielson ) , and his wife begins to feel very lonely in her large apartment . mary ann takes up a friendship with a neighbor who always gives advice , especially if it is not wanted . meanwhile , kevin nabs a case surrounding alexander cullen ( craig t . nelson ) who apparently murdered three people . he spends hours upon hours with this case , while forgetting his loving wife , who may or may not be going insane . all of this while john milton may or may not be the devil himself . after a while , things turn completely upside - down , as kevin \\' s wife claims to have seen monstrous images superimposed on her friends . a fellow employee is murdered in the park , and his mother ( judith ivey ) reveals information about kevin \\' s real father . is it all just a big nightmare ? or is john milton really satan , playing tricks with kevin \\' s life ? the devil \\' s advocate plays out fairly straight - forward , but for some odd reason , the screenwriters wanted to surprise everyone by giving us something we don \\' t expect . is this surprise conclusion supposed to make us feel good and go home without feeling depressed or disturbed ? if so , the devil \\' s advocate messes up completely , and ironically , i felt more depressed because of the ending as is now , than i would have if it had ended ten minutes early . i went into the devil \\' s advocate expecting a shocking horror film , and that is exactly what i got . i was settled in to be disturbed mentally and emotionally , and that is what i got . but what was the most disturbing and horrible aspect of the movie is the poor ending ( did i mention that i didn \\' t like the ending ? ) . the producers of this film take you on a thrilling roller coaster ride and just as it is ending , they pull the rug out from under you . films like se7en and the usual suspects can survive with this surprise ending because it is expected , more or less . we know it is going to end in an unpredictable way . the devil \\' s advocate , on the other hand , ends unpredictably , not from us knowing a lot , but knowing nothing at all . if that is confusing , i recommend watching the film , and then reading that again . as for the film overall , i enjoyed the entire first two hours , being drawn in by a terrific character study and then adding the supernatural plot to increase the tension build from the character study . the film runs like a well - built clock , slowly building until finally exploding with a highly charged climax ( and an unpredictable one at that ) . and then you settle in for a nice resolution , which does not occur . it was at this point that i felt cheated . taking us on a terror ride of intrigue , we follow kevin lomax around , as he is the centerpiece of the film . everything occurs from his perspective . he is our representation on screen ( sort of ) . but we are forced to witness a conclusion which makes most of the film seem like a game . i don \\' t want to spoil the ending , so all i can say is go see the film and decide for yourself . perhaps the most shocking thing about the devil \\' s advocate is the extreme amount of everything . it earned its r rating for a reason . there is plenty of nudity , sex , violence , gore , and then you have gore , violence , sex , and more nudity . this film really isn \\' t subtle about anything , showing us everything . it actually surprises me that this film did not receive an nc - 17 rating , as it is quite harsh . however , the movie does have its merits , and nudity and sex are among those . i don \\' t condone sex and nudity in films , but if its there , i might as well enjoy it . the biggest merit of this film is also the most interesting to watch . the confrontations between kevin lomax and john milton are entertaining , but what stands out amidst this extreme hatred is the decline of the wife , mary ann . portrayed by the extremely effective charlize theron , mary ann \\' s problems are incredibly intense , and i found myself wanting to witness her decline . this may sound uncaring , but i wanted to watch because i felt sorry for her . she is the most interesting character on the screen , who is forced into a world where she is not wanted . something the devil \\' s advocate contained actually shocked me for reasons other than extreme violence and nudity , especially for a film of this nature . the story actually has something to say about humanity . in one of the last scenes , john milton explains to kevin lomax the game god plays with his children ( he is satan , of course ) . he comments that it is human nature to lust and loathe in vanity . then , god sets up rules which contradict human nature . this semi - religious bashing is more humorous than frightening . what milton says is so true about our society that i found myself laughing out loud , partially thinking it was funny , but patially realizing it was true . these moral dilemmas are present throughout the devil \\' s advocate , giving it an added depth many films skip over in their writing ( but i \\' m sure they came straight from the novel it was based on ) . when a film has something to say about our society , it deserves to be watched . the cast of the devil \\' s advocate is one of the highlights , as we see memorable faces , and they put spins on those memorable faces we don \\' t expect . heather matarazzo makes a brief appearance as the terrorized victim in the opening court case , and she does a great job . probably the big surprise of this film is keanu reeves . he has proven himself an uneven actor ( successes such as speed and bombs such as johnny mnemonic ) , but he tops himself with this performance . i have never seen him more believable to date . al pacino is of course the scene stealer . his devilish performance is equal to those of jack nicholson ( the witches of eastwick ) and max von sydow ( needful things ) . he could have easily gone too far over the top in many scenes , but he remains completely believable ( if that is the correct term ) . jeffrey jones ( mostly known as the principal in ferris bueller \\' s day off ) also gives a good performance as eddie barzoon . judith ivey manages a credible performance as the mother who holds a secret to kevin \\' s past . connie nielson is very effective in her role , and she also appears naked several times . one familiar face with a twist was \" coach \" star , craig t . nelson , who gives a very good performance . the devil \\' s advocate is rated r for sexuality , nudity , violence , language , and some gore . at 144 minutes , this film moves along fairly quickly . for the first two hours , i sat completely engaged in the good performances and strong characters . the technical quality is also remarkable , with great special effects and a good musical score . director taylor hackford has managed to create a very disturbing motion picture , only to ruin a good chunk of tension with the final fifteen minutes . i guess my biggest problem with the ending is the fact that i went into the theater expecting a disturbing film , and hackford gave me just that for a long time . but just before the end , he got jitterish and relied on the hollywood safety net in order to make his film more mainstream . personally , i would have preferred it ending fifteen minutes early .',\n",

       " (\"after a stylistic detour with mrs . parker and the vicious circle ( which , despite its uncomfortable tone , was close to being a conventional movie ) , director alan rudolph has returned to his unique brand of film making with afterglow , a romantic black comedy about love , betrayal , and self - absorption . while these may not be the most unusual themes to fashion into a motion picture , rudolph ' s atypical approach to the characters and their situations makes for an intriguing , if not always pleasant , movie . it is said that rudolph is a polarizing director ? meaning that most viewers either love his work or hate it . until mrs . parker , i had not been overly impressed by his movies . i found equinox , his last pre - mrs . parker effort , to be irritating and frustrating . i was somewhat surprised , therefore , to discover that i liked afterglow . there are several reasons for this , but the paramount one is that rudolph seems to have muted some of the most strident , mannered aspects of his approach . the characters here are more like real people with genuine problems , the story is absorbing , and the acting is top - notch . in short , rudolph has created a world that it ' s worth spending two hours in . afterglow introduces us to two unhappily married couples . jeffrey byron ( jonny lee miller ) is a cold , seemingly - heartless businessman who is sexually indifferent to his young wife , marianne ( lara flynn boyle ) . for her part , marianne is so obsessed with having a baby that she never attempts to interact with her husband on a human level . all she ' s interested in is seducing him during those few days when she ' s ovulating . after he refuses to make love , she decides to find someone else to play the role of sperm donor . the other couple , lucky ( nick nolte ) and phyllis mann ( julie christie ) , are an older pair , but they ' re no more content than jeffrey and marianne . a mysterious fracture in their past relationship has driven them apart . they remain married as a matter of convenience , but , since phyllis won ' t allow lucky to touch her , they have an unspoken agreement whereby he can fool around as much as he wants provided that no lasting bond is established as a result of these affairs . the landscape of emotional pain between them is palpable . the four characters begin interacting when marianne hires lucky as a handyman to fix up the inside of the apartment she shares with jeffrey . the two of them are immediately attracted to one another , and it doesn ' t take long before they ' re lounging together , naked , in her pool . meanwhile , jeffrey , who is captivated by older women , runs into phyllis in a hotel bar , is smitten , and invites her to accompany him on a weekend retreat to the mountains . the romantic couplings of the characters are interesting in that they illustrate the multiple faces of love . sex means something different to everyone ? to jeffrey , it ' s an unpleasant chore , a loss of control ; to marianne , it ' s a means to a maternal end ; to lucky , it ' s an enjoyable distraction that blocks out his marital troubles ; and to phyllis , it ' s a method of establishing or denying emotional closeness . ultimately , none of these characters appears to love anyone else as much as they love themselves . the greatest strength of the film lies not in the script , but in the performances . jonny lee miller is perfect as the selfish , callous , suit - and - tie businessman . those who recall him as sickboy in trainspotting will find that he is almost unrecognizable here as the image of conformity . lara flynn boyle , who wasn ' t impressive in rudolph ' s equinox , is greatly improved , making marianne a jumble of sexiness and vulnerability . nick nolte is delightful as the uninhibited lucky , and he manages to deliver some of rudolph ' s most pregnant lines with practiced ease . the clear standout , however , is julie christie , who is nothing short of delicious as the world - weary phyllis . her often wry , occasionally cutting asides are the source of much of the film ' s humor , and there ' s hardly ever a moment when she doesn ' t steal the spotlight from her co - stars . i don ' t know if afterglow is the film to convert rudolph - detractors , but it seems that this movie is a little more accessible than some of the director ' s earlier productions . enough of his trademark style remains , however , to reassure his supporters . afterglow is basically a four - pronged character study . the plot is not especially compelling , but the character interaction is , and that ' s the real reason to see this motion picture . rudolph has painted an able picture of the non - romantic side of love -- the one that has more to do with tolerance and familiarity than with affection and attraction .\",\n",

purports to be a comedy exploring the relationship between men and women satirizing the whole pop - psychology mars / venus phenomenon . but what this movie winds up being is a collection of unfunny cringe - inducing moments coupled with uninsightful cringe - inducing moments ; the end result is , unsurprisingly , an unfunny , uninsightful , cringe - inducing , thoroughly icky embarrassment . garry shandling plays an alien from a planet populated by technologically advanced but emotionally vacant males ( they reproduce through cloning , of course ) . his leaders put a select group of males through a series of tests designed to determine which one is most fit to fly off to earth , find a female of the species , and impregnate her . they \\' re taught how to pretend that they \\' re listening by nodding and saying \" uh - huh , \" and how to compliment shoes . imagine my delighted surprise when , oh heavens , all their carefully practiced tactics turn out to fail miserably , producing comedic results ! the lucky winner is fitted with a penis ( since theirs , after generations of disuse have long since shrunk out of existence . . . i will restrain myself from mentioning the implausibility of such a scenario since the population has stopped evolving due to the fact that they \\' re all just clones . . . whoops , too late . ) the penis , when aroused , tends to make a humming noise . the writers , when frequently strapped for ideas , tend to turn to this as a source of \" comedy . \" it isn \\' t funny the first time . it isn \\' t funny the eighth time . it isn \\' t funny the eighteenth time . if anything , it made me feel vaguely self - conscious . garry meets up with a coworker at a bank played by greg kinnear , who turns out to be a generic , unlikable scumbag . he \\' s meant to fill the part of unfortunate role model for shandling \\' s alien character , but he \\' s so flatly drawn that even the writers quickly give up and toss him aside . kinnear \\' s scumbagginess is demonstrated by the fact that he claims other peoples \\' work as his own to worm his way into a vice presidents \\' position and goes to aa meetings to pick up chicks . wow . what a magnificent bastard . nearly every man in the movie , in fact , is played as the same sort of sex - driven slimeball . when kinnear \\' s wife walks into the office , there isn \\' t a single guy who doesn \\' t trip , bump into a wall , or otherwise pratfall as if they \\' d never seen a woman before . the few guys that aren \\' t particularly slimeballs , such as john goodman \\' s detective character , are simply uncommunicative workaholics . shandling meets up with annette bening , who will inevitably prove to be the love he never knew existed , at one of kinnear \\' s aa meetings . shandling \\' s mission is to have a baby , and when he reveals his desires to her , bening instantly falls for him , and the next day . . . they get married . yup . the next day . cuz ya see , it turns out she wants a baby too ! bening \\' s character perhaps was the most difficult to watch , especially after seeing her come apart at the seams so effectively in american beauty . . . if her character here is supposed to be representing the female of the species as a whole , then woe , i say , to the species . she \\' s unfathomably insecure , and succumbs so easily to all of shandling \\' s lines and lies that it borders on tragic . there \\' s a point where , after thinking she may not be able to bear children , she learns that she is indeed pregnant . when garry comes home after nearly cheating on her , she strolls into the kitchen and sings \" high hopes \" ( you know , the uplifting ant and the rubber tree plant song ) to deliver the news , and then says to him , \" now you can \\' t leave me . \" we \\' re supposed to empathize with shandling \\' s discovery of the feeling of \" guilt , \" but instead i wanted to weep for bening that she was placing her entire life and soul firmly in the lap of a great big nothing . and eventually , shandling falls in love with her . . . for real , i suppose , though i \\' m not sure exactly what prompted it . what \\' s the message i derive from all this ? men are liars , inherently empty creatures , but if you hang around long enough . . . well , maybe something will click . ha ha . . . ha ? i \\' m thankful such broad cynicism isn \\' t frequently allowed to run so rampant . let \\' s all join hands and pray that the planet these folks are from is not this one . there \\' s also a subplot involving john goodman as an airline incident investigator that wades in the bog of stupidity . goodman , through a series of astoundingly implausible realizations , puts together the fact that shandling is a being from another world with a magic , vibrating penis . it has all the makings for a subplot of having shandling be discovered , that , thankfully , never comes to the inevitable hackneyed fruition . instead , it just dangles limply on the branch for a while , withers , and falls away . further proof that goodman should just stick to doing coen brothers movies . but let \\' s not dwell on this any longer , i \\' ve already wasted plenty of your time and my own . let \\' s move on , forget about what we \\' ve seen here , and get on with our lives . and to help us out , let \\' s end things on a happy note . . . congratuations go out to annette bening , winner of this week \\' s \" title ! \" award , for delivering the awkward line of dialog containing the movie \\' s name .',\n",

       " (\"screen story by kevin yagher and andrew kevin walker . screenplay by andrew kevin walker . inspired by the short story the legend of sleepy hollow by washington irving . directed by tim burton . starring johnny depp , christina ricci , and casper van dien . special appearances by christopher lee and christopher walken . synopsis : investigator ichabod crane journeys to 1799 sleepy hollow to investigate a series of murders involving decapitation . townspeople believe the spirit of a dead german mercenary is threatening them . cute blonde katrina and a listless orphan help crane solve the mystery . comments : tim burton has directed a number of entertaining and groundbreaking films over the years . batman , of course , is perhaps his best - known film and led to a string of less successful sequels . he ' s done biographical work ( on the director ed wood ) , children ' s movies ( nightmare before christmas ) , and a homage to alien invasion movies ( mars attacks ! ) . sleepy hollow , his newest feature which fans have been anticipating for a while , shares the similar dark and atmospheric style of his earlier work and counts among his better movies . sleepy hollow quite obviously draws its inspiration from the old period horror films of the 1950s and 1960s , especially hammer studios ' reworkings of dracula and frankenstein , and american international ' s series of movies based on the works of edgar allan poe . christopher lee , in fact , star of many hammer productions over the years , appears at the beginning of sleepy hollow as a judge who sends ichabod crane out to investigate the murders . the movie also borrows from the universal monster movies of the 1930s . one of the climatic scenes involves a windmill and obviously takes its cue from frankenstein . i mention these allusions for a reason . seasoned horror film fans , including myself , will smile at their inclusion in this film . with the recent disappointments in theatrically released horror movies , especially the blair witch project ( the most overblown turkey of the decade ) , we needed a film like this . not only does it have a sense of history , but burton ' s skillful use of setting and mood make this an entertaining exercise in horror . the film ' s eerie landscapes and foggy towns , indeed , overshadow the actors and the plot as the most noteworthy aspect of the movie . johnny depp , a veteran tim burton actor who has appeared both in ed wood and edward scissorhands , plays ichabod crane , who has apparently changed occupations from irving ' s original story and is now an investigator . depp is adequate in his role . no more ; no less . equally adequate is christina ricci , who plays the love interest in the film . she ' s a good witch too . how cute . one of the few weak parts of sleepy hollow is the wooden and cliched dialogue between the main characters . the two actors , however , carry the movie well enough , but the supporting cast is what makes this movie shine . veteran actors such as jeffrey jones and michael gough ( who played the butler alfred in all four recent batman flicks ) are terrific as the aging townsfolk involved in the conspiracy which depp uncovers . while i do not wish to reveal crucial plot points , i can say that the storyline becomes quite confusing . you have to pay attention . andrew kevin walker wrote the screenplay . he ' s the one who also wrote 8 mm and seven . walker is quickly becoming one of the premiere suspense writers in hollywood , and sleepy hollow certainly doesn ' t hurt his growing reputation . as one might imagine from a gentleman like walker , sleepy hollow is quite graphic . there ' s a lot of blood and a lot of beheadings . this is definately not a flick to take the young kids to . a lady in front of us took her two young sons to see it and spent about 25 - 30 minutes covering the youngest ' s eyes with her hand . he was obviously upset by the movie ' s intense violence . if you ' re looking for a good scare , however , sleepy hollow is definately recommended .\",\n",

( \" hoods in the woods , \" is what the \" ground - pounders \" yell out when the convicts are bused in to help them fight the fire . ) along the way , shaye picks up an ornithologist hostage played by suzy amis , who turns out to have been trained in warrior ways by her father , who was a marine drill instructor . most of the highly predictable movie is a long chase in which poor howie long is given one ridiculous stunt after another to look silly performing . he flings a chain saw backwards over his head while riding a speeding motorcycle so that the saw can hit the windshield of the pursuing truck . arguably the low point is when he escapes from a locked burning building by riding a motorcycle conveniently parked inside . using a ramp , he shoots straight out of the top of the building \\' s attic , and when he hits the ground , he just rides off in a cloud of dust . when the film isn \\' t using some stock footage of actual forest fires , the simulated ones look hokey . editor jack hofstra cheapens the action even more by his use of burning flames in scene transitions . the ending , with its sick twists , manages to be even worse than the rest of the movie . perhaps the best that can be said for the picture is the faint praise i heard afterwards in the lobby , \" it \\' s not as bad as some of the television sitcoms . \" firestorm runs mercifully just 1 : 29 . it is rated r for violence and language and would be acceptable for teenagers .',\n",

( while the depiction is not biblically accurate , it is entertaining and might be excuse enough to familiarize ourselves with the true record by reading what is written in genesis 7 . ) a positive note is that the studio has avoided any segment which is as perversely dark as nihgt on bald mountain upon which the original film ended . there are some images based upon fantasy such as the flying whales in respighi ' s pines of rome or images which have their roots in mythology such as the ethereal creatures which tell the story of nature ' s cycle of life , death , and rebirth in igor stravinsky ' s firebird suite . but the stories they tell are uplifting , containing nothing too frightening for our younger children . the darkest segment , spiritually speaking , actually belongs to the only holdover from the original fantasia , mickey mouse in the sorcerer ' s apprentice by paul dukas . but overall , the emotions evoked from fantasia 2000 are positive ones , being full of hope and promise . music has an impact which can be undeniably felt , capable of leading the listener to emotional peaks and inspirational highs simply not attainable through other mediums . it is no wonder that the levites , as the priestly tribe of the old testament , were also the appointed musicians . if fantasia 2000 is able to introduce a new audience to music which inspires and exalts , it will have done an incredible service .\",\n",

       " ('my filmcritic . com colleague norm schrager nailed session 9 , brad anderson \\' s throwback to spooky horror films from the 70 \\' s . it worked as an eerie homage without being self - referential or smugly postmodern . genre aficionados will acknowledge the similarities in tone to stanley kubrick \\' s the shining and george romero \\' s dawn of the dead without being taken out of the engrossing narrative ( i . e . , a psychologically addled waste management team clears out an abandoned lunatic asylum ; unspeakable dread ensues ) . in a double - whammy for 2001 , anderson shoots and ( mostly ) scores again with his eclectic riff on time - travel episodes from the twilight zone , appropriately titled happy accidents . much like session 9 , the cards are played very close to the vest here . is boyish , eccentric \" sam deed from dubuque , iowa \" a futuristic voyager from the year 2470 or just your run - of - the - mill psychologically disturbed nutcase let loose on the present - day streets of nyc ? as played by wonderful character actor vincent d \\' onofrio ( full metal jacket ) , it \\' s up in the air whether or not we should accept his detailed monologues about life after the polar ice caps have melted . the question proves to be moot , at least for a time . even if the whole thing proves to be a creative delusion , one agrees with the character judgment passed down on him by his new girlfriend , ruby ( marisa tomei ) : \" he \\' s a freak , but he sure tells a good story ! \" neurotic ruby thinks she may have found true love after a series of nightmarish dating disasters ( the junkie , the fetishist , the artist , the frenchman , etc . ) , but isn \\' t quite sure how to handle \" sam deed \" when he starts explaining the barcode on his arm , his elaborately constructed fake identity , his pathological fear of dogs , his ability to speak five different languages , and his mission to change a crucial moment in time that may have ramifications on time \\' s alternate realities . ( don \\' t ask . ) it \\' s all a bit much to take in . ruby \\' s close friend gretchen ( cuz ya can \\' t have a love story without the token friend , though nadia dajani invests the thankless role with warmth ) chalks it up as a sexy role - playing game , but her cautious therapist ( holland taylor ) warns her that co - dependency is rearing its ugly head again and she \\' s in over her head with yet another doomed relationship . who ya gonna believe ? despite her winning an academy award , marisa tomei has always struck me as an annoying and unwelcome screen presence , one that undermines the pleasure of watching happy accidents . her brassy new yawk attitude never really meshes with her desperate desire to appear \" cute \" to her adoring fans . being loud and flashing a ( disingenuous ) smile does not necessarily equal \" substantial and sexy . \" it takes more than a crack team of hair and wardrobe people to imbue her with personality . then there \\' s that damned voice , which strains to be oh - so - adorable . look , this stuff is purely subjective . some people feel this way about richard gere , others cannot bear to watch robin williams \\' hyperactive schtick . for my money , it \\' s m . tomei with a bullet . happy accidents is a romantic comedy filtered through twelve monkeys ( or , more appropriately , chris marker \\' s la jetee , especially with those still framed \" memory \" photographs anderson employs as a stylistic device throughout ) . modern manhattan is filmed with an otherworldly , vaguely alien eye with a color scheme oddly reminiscent of logan \\' s run . as the stranger in a strange land , d \\' onofrio walks slightly out - of - step , wonderfully affable but often inscrutable with his wayward expressions and bemused detachment . this is science fiction told mainly via the power of suggestion ( though it often falls into the sci - fi trap of having entirely too much forced exposition -- we want deeds , not words ! ) at least twenty minutes too long , happy accidents eventually gets around to a race - against - time scenario that puts \" sam deed \" to the ultimate test . no movie can live in ambiguity forever , but anderson seems terminally unable to provide satisfactory conclusions to his otherwise well structured recent narratives . ( let \\' s pretend the loathsome and predictable next stop wonderland never happened , shall we ? ) there are also some slow , repetitive stretches as ruby and sam go over the same arguments again and again over whether or not he \\' s crazy . the premise is strong enough to sustain interest , but it \\' s enough to throw a nod in the general direction of rod serling for wrapping up his ideas in half - hour time slots , commercials included .',\n",

       " ('gothic murder - mystery yarns are not a new conceit . in fact , they \\' ve been around in books and on film for many , many years . without the proper handling , they come off as old - fashioned , bland , and outdated . \" the gift , \" directed by sam raimi , is a tried - and - true effort that surprises very little , and includes everything from a wide array of suspects and red herrings , to mansions in the deep south with moss trees out front , to the eventual discovery of a waterlogged corpse found in a nearby pond . it \\' s fairly obvious who the killer is ; in fact , i predicted who it would be before the movie began and was correct in my preliminary suspicions . the film ultimately shouldn \\' t work , but it does , thanks to a sparkling cast that fills each character with so many memorable nuances , the most fun to be had is in simply watching the people interact with each other . annie wilson ( cate blanchett ) is a recently widowed mother of three sons who makes her living giving psychic readings to the residents of her backwater southern hometown . some of her mainstay clients include valerie barksdale ( hilary swank ) , who is severely abused by her husband donnie ( keanu reeves ) , and buddy cole ( giovanni ribisi ) , an unstable mechanic who is confused by the nightmares he \\' s been having about a mysterious blue diamond that is somehow linked to his father . for annie , she does not give the readings merely for money , but uses it as a way of seeking solace in finding the good in everyone \\' s future . her late grandmother ( rosemary harris ) told her as a child that it was a gift she was given , and she should always remember that . when annie \\' s eldest son is involved in a fight at school , she meets the nice - guy school principal , wayne collins ( greg kinnear ) , whom she finds herself attracted to . but wayne is engaged to the wealthy jessica king ( katie holmes ) , whom annie immediately gets a negative vibe about . at a party with her best friend linda ( kim dickens ) , annie stumbles upon jessica in a compromising position with lawyer david duncan ( gary cole ) . soon after , jessica has disappeared , leaving everyone in a frenzy over what could have possibly happened to her , and annie starts to have nightmares and apparitions linking jessica with the vicious redneck donnie barksdale , and the pond behind his home . \" the gift \" may be cliched on a sheer storytelling level , but the performances and tight direction from raimi ( who has redeemed himself for his embarrassing last film , 1999 \\' s \" for love of the game \" ) lift the picture up several notches . slowly enveloping the viewer into the many intriguing characters and their individual plights , the disappearance of jessica at the 30 - minute mark divulges the movie \\' s true intentions and transforms the proceedings into a taut , at times frightening , horror - mystery . at the center of the film is the exceptional cate blanchett ( 1999 \\' s \" the talented mr . ripley \" ) , who turns annie wilson from what could have been little more than a run - of - the - mill protagonist into a very exact , down - to - earth , realistic person with valid troubles and a caring attitude towards those around her . blanchett takes the unextraordinary material and runs with it , giving the entire film a truly classy aura that it otherwise might not have had . we follow her at every turn because she is so mesmerizing , both as a character and an actress . blanchett isn \\' t the only bright performer , as she is ably supported by one of the best casts of the year . in her first role following her oscar win for 1999 \\' s \" boys don \\' t cry , \" hilary swank is excellent as the confused valerie , who seeks guidance from annie , but is too scared to take her biggest advice of all : to leave the grossly abusive donnie . as donnie , keanu reeves ( 2000 \\' s \" the watcher \" ) makes an utterly convincing backwoods meanie , so much so that it is difficult to believe he is an actor at all . for the often - criticized reeves , whose acting abilities have never been the best , this is the biggest compliment he could possibly get , and it is also one of the better performances he has given . giovanni ribisi ( 2000 \\' s \" the boiler room \" ) is heartbreaking as a mentally slow young man who sees annie as his only friend , and wants her to do nothing but help him understand why he is being plagued by bad dreams about his dad . in the small , but pivotal role of the sleazy jessica king , katie holmes ( 2000 \\' s \" wonder boys \" ) has turned in yet another stunning supporting turn . her promiscuous role of jessica is one she has never played before , and she is radiant in her few scenes . finally , kim dickens ( 2000 \\' s \" hollow man \" ) makes her usual strong impression as annie \\' s spicy best friend , linda . the other notable aspect of \" the gift \" is its moody atmosphere that lays such a thickly foreboding air over every scene it \\' s almost suffocating . thanks to cleverly construed editing by arthur coburn and bob murawski , and the successful use of different eerie sounds effects and a very good music score by christopher young , the movie not only achieves a scary undercurrent , but one that is filled with dread . helped along by a strong screenplay by billy bob thornton and tom epperson , which makes the most of its setting and delightful cast , \" the gift \" is that rarest of thrillers that actually thrills , and offers up a fair share of chills , too . it may not be groundbreakingly original , but it sure is an entertaining ride for the duration of its running time .',\n",

       " ('\" a man is not a man without eight taels of gold . \" starring sammo hung , sylvia chang ; directed by mabel cheung ; written by cheung and alex law ; cinematography by bill wong eight taels of gold begins as a fish out of water story and at some point becomes a love story involving two people whose past choices prevent the fruition of their love . neither aspect of the movie is entirely successful , but both are good enough . and along the way there is one perfect scene , which is one more than you find in most films . slim ( played by portly sammo hung , better known as a star and director of hong kong action movies ) is a chinese immigrant who drives a yellow cab in new york . when the movie opens , we see him shouting obscenities at another taxi driver . he does not seem particularly out of place . in fact , he is about to return to visit his home in rural china for the first time in sixteen years , spending most of his life savings in the process , and it is there that he will become the proverbial fish out of water , as he realizes that you can never go home . he brings with him some statue of liberty cigarette lighters , cheap sunglasses , and lobsters ( which have to be large , to prove they \\' re american ) -- the tokens of his success . he also wears a gold chain and a gold watch , because without eight taels of gold , a man is not a man ( my dictionary tells me that taels are a unit of weight used in the far east , and i assume the phrase is a chinese proverb ) . he loses most of this stuff -- except the gold -- when his van crashes into a river and he has to hitch a ride , so to speak , on a raft along the river which runs past his parents \\' village . when he arrives unannounced , he almost induces cardiac arrest in his father . all of this has the makings of a routine comedy , and the movie has its amusing moments , as when the villagers take turns giving slim gifts during a celebration of his homecoming , and they all give him birds , so by evening \\' s end he is surrounded by turkeys , ducks , geese and other sundry fowl . but eight taels is not a comedy -- it is a sad , sweet story about the choices people make , and how they are sometimes irreparable . director mabel cheung ( an autumn \\' s tale , the soong sisters ) sees clearly what it is like to have lived half of your life in one country and half in a country on the other side of the world -- what it is like to no longer have a place to call home . slim does not belong in china , nor does he belong in america , where he can barely speak the language . seeing water buffalo in the fields and rafts poled down the river and fireworks exploding gloriously in the sky over a small village , we come to know the world slim left behind , and it seems as if he too is knowing it for the first time , and wishes it felt more like home . the condition of the expatriate is eloquently portrayed ; i , being one , was sympathetic . on his way to his parent \\' s village , slim hooks up with jenny ( sylvia chang ) , whom he knew when she was a girl nicknamed odds - and - ends , which is what he continues to call her , although she is now a mature , professional , attractive woman , to be married in the spring to an american - chinese man . slim and odds - and - ends fall for each other . that \\' s predictable . the manner in which their ( non - ) romance is played out is not . the emotions involved are adult and complex , and the film avoids cheap solutions to their dilemma . it \\' s typical , for instance , that the fianc ? in this sort of plot be a colossal jerk , because it makes it easier to empathize with the unrequited lover . but here the fianc ? is a decent , ordinary guy , and although slim would like to feel anger , he cannot . the fianc ? has done nothing wrong ; the situation is the result of bad luck or bad decisions , take your pick . eight taels has its share of flaws ( the early sequences in america and on the plane to china are especially weak ) , but it compensates with insight . when odds - and - ends tells slim that her future husband wants to move to san francisco , she notes resignedly , \" it \\' s all the same . wherever we go , we \\' ll be in chinatown , \" and her straightforward statement expresses much . there is insight , too , in the understanding of the consequences of slim and odds - and - ends \\' decisions : he to move to america , she to marry a chinese - american . both their choices were perhaps born of impatience , perhaps of a sense that the grass is always greener -- and it turns out that both choices were wrong . but they cannot undo them ; they must live with what they have done . such is life . the movie is tender toward these people , but it offers no false comforts . everything that is right and true about eight taels comes together in one great scene , which is the culmination of the love story . slim and odds - and - ends sit in a secluded spot and talk hesitantly , with the muted pop - pop of fireworks exploding in the night behind them , and it seems the conversation will lead to a kiss . the exchange that follows , and what slim then does , is poignant and perfect : with clarity and understatement , we see two people \\' s lives , their heartbreaks and virtues , summed up in a single moment . yes , the film is flawed , but moments like that justify most of its inadequacies .',\n",

       " ('for the first reel of girls town , you just can \\' t get over lili taylor . is it possible to remain unperturbed that a woman of this age is playing a high school student ? harder still , can you avoid astonishment at how perfect she is in the part ? with the sure , showy expertise of a de niro , taylor imbues unwed mother patti with all the faux fuck - you confidence she can muster . it \\' s a deeply felt , dead - on performance , and by the halfway point you \\' ve forgiven taylor her own maturity . for all its verite pretenses , girls town is less about a bunch of high - schoolers than it is about a movie director and a cadre of writer - performers examining their own feelings about rape , relationships , and american womanhood . the movie \\' s opening scenes sketch an easy friendship between a group of four smart / sassy high school outsiders on the verge of graduation : patti , angela ( bruklin harris ) , emma ( anna grace ) , and nikki ( aunjanue ellis ) . but about 10 minutes into the film , we get word that nikki has swallowed a fistful of pills and bowed out of life . the remaining girls manage to smug nikki \\' s diary out of her grieving mother \\' s home , and page through it at patti \\' s place , investigating the root of nikki \\' s despair . what they find is cruel and galvanizing -- nikki had been raped by an editor at a newspaper where she interned , and was privately questioning the sanity and value of a world where such a thing could happen . shell - shocked by the truth of the matter , the three girls begin to talk among themselves and come to a realization about their own lives . emma says she was raped last year on a date with a football player . patti \\' s barely sympathetic , wondering what the hell emma thought she was doing with her shirt off in a jock \\' s car . and anyway , patti \\' s had her own share of guys who wouldn \\' t take no for an answer . pained , acrimonious debate ensues as the trio grow more and more angry -- angry about the impossibility of saying no , and angry with themselves for being weak , for being naive , for putting up with it . \" why do we put up with it ? \" emma finally asks , once the argument has reached a fever pitch . \" we try to talk about it , and look what happens . we fight for 20 minutes . \" there \\' s the admirable crux of this picture . girls town is a political film , in that it calls for action . but it \\' s incomplete - it \\' s never quite sure how to justify that action , or what form it should take . the trio become crusaders for their right to dignity , and it \\' s surely one of this year \\' s most stirring movie moments when emma lobs a concrete block through the passenger - side window of that damn jock \\' s car ( doing the right thing ? ) . they hang out in the bathroom , chatting incessantly and scrawling slogans and naming names on the door to a toilet stall . \" subvert the patriarchy , \" emma writes , and then starts a hall of shame list underneath that other students begin to contribute to . the girls silence their hecklers , take revenge on the deadbeat father of patti \\' s child , and eventually come face - to - face with nikki \\' s tormentor . still , the movie has a desperately unfinished quality , and none of these subsequent exploits is particularly satisfying . ( you keep waiting for someone to call the cops on these brazen girls , but nobody thinks of it . ) perhaps searching for a resolution missing from the material at hand , the film borrows its epigraphs from audre lorde and queen latifah ( \" who you callin \\' a bitch ? \" ) . the points are well taken , but they should have been unnecessary . long on characterization but a little short on story , girls town is less than it could have been , and too self - congratulatory for my own taste . director jim mckay is best known as a consort of r . e . m . \\' s michael stipe ( he directed the nearly unwatchable tourfilm for that band ) , and girls town is his first foray into feature filmmaking . the movie was created and scripted by committee , but mckay and his lead performers had to shoot on a shoestring when , predictably , the group couldn \\' t secure funding . then again , girls town on a budget would hardly be the same film . the movie \\' s slapdash quality is key to its significance . truth be told , all three of the leads look too wise for high school , but that \\' s ok -- there \\' s a once - removed quality to their fine , spontaneous performances , as the women take a very skillful look back at the girls they once were , the girls they wish they had been , or some combination . for all its flaws , this one gets extra points for having its uncertain head and heart in the same noble place .',\n",

) in the hospital . tensions mount and distrust build among the rest as they watch their chance for the bonus start to slip away . but , there is more , much more , at stake as the hospital and its history of insanity weigh on them all . i don \\' t want to give away too much of the story of \" session 9 , \" so i \\' ll stop there . what we have here is a spooky horror flick that uses none of the jump - out - at - you - from - the - dark cheap shots that have become part and parcel with horror films since the advent of \" halloween \" and \" friday the thirteenth . \" there is no cat leaping out of the dark or the shock of suddenly seeing oneself in a strategically placed mirror . with the exception of one shadowy and chilling image at one point spooky interlude in the film , there is little that you can get your arms around as far as what , specifically , is \" frightening . \" as i watched \" session 9 \" i became aware of the subtle things that built up during the story that make it a true horror movie . the striking high - definition video camera work by uta briesewitz ( who worked with the director , brad anderson , on his \" next stop wonderland \" ) helps to build up tension with close - ups , fluid camera movement and odd angles in a way that would make alfred hitchcock proud . music , too , is used to intense effect , joining with the camera to make simple scenes frightening , even horrifying . couple these tech feats with an intelligent story that uses elements of \" the shining , \" \" the blair witch project \" and , even \" the texas chainsaw massacre \" and you get a decent , intriguing horror flick . additionally , the brilliant decision to shoot at danvers state hospital gives the film another starring character , the institution itself , which lends even more chills to the equation . acting is another factor that raises \" session 9 \" above the usual dreck presented in recent horror hits like \" scream , \" \" i know what you did last summer \" and their sequels . those films took good - looking , though generic , young actors and actresses and put them to use to build up a body count , substituting mayhem for real horror . anderson opted , instead , to use mature , experienced actors like peter mullan and david caruso to fill his characters \\' shoes and the difference in casting quality is notable . mullan , in particular , puts an arc on his character , gordon , as the troubled guy who slowly and inexorably falls under the pressures of family , job and , finally , danvers state hospital . the rest of the small cast fit the bill as people , not just fodder for the mayhem . david caruso , as gordo \\' s senior man and near equal in the business , shows just how good an actor he is . he made the jump from tv \\' s \" nypd blue \" to film far too soon and his decisions in the roles he took ( i \\' ll never forget the horrendous \" jade \" ) were less than star making . he rolls his sleeves up and does the job well here . gevedon , lucas and sexton are more than fodder , too . the only problem with \" session 9 \" lay in the uninspired ending . it takes on a fairly conventional finale that covers old ground and is a bit of a disappointment after the terrific ( and inspired ) build up . the pleasure is getting there and i wish that anderson and gevedon had kept up the steam they had so ably built during the bulk of the film \" session 9 \" is an unusual feat . it is scary , doesn \\' t use cheap tricks and raises goose bumps with its intelligently rendered , subtle horror . because of the local interest of danvers , it should do well with the northeast crowd . i hope it gets the national distribution it deserves . i give it a b + .',\n",

       " ('my opinion on a film can be easily swayed by the presence of actors i love . i love ralph fiennes . i love uma thurman . i love sean connery . hell , i \\' m even a big fan of jim broadbent and fiona shaw . i saw the fantastic preview for the avengers nearly eight months ago , and i \\' ve been eagerly awaiting the film ever since . a few months into the summer , however , i noticed that its release date had been changed a few times , and that it had ended up in the mid - august dumping ground . then , in this final week before its official release , i learned that it was not to be screened for critics . and that the actors had not been plugging the film on late night programs . and that it was directed by the same man who brought us the remake of diabolique . my expectations fell to pieces when i learned all of these things . the film i saw today didn \\' t even meet those expectations . this is a lousy , incoherent mess . i would slam it harder , if it weren \\' t for the nifty sets and the mere presence of all these fine , lovable actors . but sets are ultimately empty , and the performances are completely uninspired . that \\' s the main problem with the avengers : for all it \\' s hip - hop flash and tidal waves , none of it feels the least bit energetic or inspired . it \\' s like a chore , a bland exercise in superhero film making . it also feels like its been cut to pieces , clocking in at 90 minutes and forgetting to close some of its own subplots . this is just plain depressing . the avengers is a film version of the popular 60s television show . frequent readers of mine will not be surprised to learn that i \\' ve never watched an episode . i wasn \\' t alive then . i don \\' t even watch television now . i \\' m very sorry that i don \\' t have this perspective , but , judging from the reviews i \\' ve already read , knowing the tv show just makes matters worse . i didn \\' t know and love john steed and emma peel , and therefore i was not as upset to see how these actors i love have managed to thrash their roles . i also doubt that familiarity with the series would allow me to understand more clearly the chain of events that do take place in this film . based on what the film told me , i gather that steed ( fiennes ) is some kind of british super guy ( somewhat like james bond ) , and that dr . peel ( thurman ) is just a really smart doctor , who also happens to know a lot about weather and about beating people up while limited by tight leather suits . they are to work together , under mother \\' s orders ( mother is played by jolly jim broadbent , while his co - conspirator , father , is played by the equally - talented fiona shaw ) . it seems that there is a man out there controlling the weather . his name is de wynter ( connery ) . he is a crazy scottish guy . our heroes had better stop him , or else . . . the weather will keep getting colder until they \" have to go to hell to warm up \" ( one of the film \\' s few funny lines ) . along the way there is subplot after subplot , hinged sloppily together by scenes that go nowhere , feel perfunctory , and ultimately make no sense . for example , our heroes are eventually attacked by a swarm of giant mechanical insects with machineguns attached to their torsos . now , killer bugs don \\' t really go with the weather - controlling theme of the film . the purpose of the bugs , other than to annihilate our heroes , is never established . they \\' re never even directly connected to de wynter ( they \\' re controlled by his crazy henchman , played by eddie izzard ) . the special effects aren \\' t bad , but they \\' re loud , obnoxious , and intrusive . like so many scenes in the film , it seems present only to keep your attention from waning . and i guarantee you , it will wane . i stopped thinking about the story when i realized it didn \\' t do any good to think . the avengers has clearly been chopped up and re - assembled so many times that even the people involved couldn \\' t tell us what happens . there are several scenes in the preview that didn \\' t make the final cut . in addition , many of the sequences have irritating , grainy film quality , which makes it feel low - budget ( the last scene is particularly bad ) . the scenes that don \\' t feature action should be electric , thanks to our wonderful cast . they aren \\' t . the action scenes should be electric , because this is an action film . they aren \\' t , either . and what about this wasted cast ? oh , it makes me weep with disappointment . we \\' re talking ralph fiennes here , one of the best actors working today , one of the best actors * ever * . i love the guy . i \\' ve loved all his films , until this one . he seems like he wants to understand the film , but he \\' s as lost as we are . and thurman , in all of her spectacular beauty and talent , can \\' t manage to look at home here . ( i don \\' t blame her completely , for there is a strange subplot involving her evil twin that is never explained in any way , and it can \\' t be easy to deal with such terrible screenwriting . ) connery , however , seems the most out of it , totally lacking any kind of focus , or interest , for that matter . who is to blame ? is it the screenwriter , don macpherson ? perhaps , although i can see a shell of a story here that could have been a good superhero movie had it been handled right . is it the actors ? for god \\' s sake , no -- these people clearly lost interest when they saw the inevitable path of destruction on which this film was travelling . i blame director jeremiah chechik , who shouldn \\' t have been given the task to begin with . his best film , benny & joon , is quirky in the same way that this one was supposed to be , but here it mostly seems like a lot of failed attempts at wit and humor . add to that a lack of experience in big - budget action , and you have the worst choice for director this side of james ivory . if the avengers has a saving grace , it \\' s the set design . the sets ( by stuart craig ) are big , colorful , and often pleasing to look at . i like the final set - piece , on de wynter \\' s island , even if none of it makes a bit of sense . i admired the overhead view of the stairs , showing dr . peel running around in circles and never getting anywhere . i also enjoyed michael kamen \\' s music score , particularly in the opening credits . but this stuff is routine -- good sets and music are nice , but there \\' s a lot more that needs to be here . inspiration , for instance , would have been really nice . maybe a little bit of cohesion in the story . or a sense of purpose . most of all , though , i would have liked to see these actors relish in their roles . damn this movie for not giving them the chance .',\n",

\" i \\' m wondering the same thing . i feel like i should have had a grand time with \" detroit rock city . \" it \\' s the sort of movie i wish i could \\' ve had a lot of fun with , but i didn \\' t . i just didn \\' t . surely this film isn \\' t trying to win any major awards , so should i have expected an oscar - caliber film ? no , but i expected something . a funny joke . a clever prank . a plot development . anything . the movie never delivers . you \\' ve got to marvel at how the filmmakers managed to come up with a movie that is truly about nothing . \" detroit rock city \" is one of those films that you walk out of after the credits have rolled and realize that you just spent 90 minutes watching a movie in which absolutely nothing happened to justify the film \\' s existence , and it \\' s not a very satisfying realization . the film is about four teenage boys , all huge kiss fans from cleveland , trying to get into a kiss concert in detroit , michigan . that \\' s it . there is no big plot description in this review , because the movie has very little plot . the characters are hawk ( edward furlong ) , lex ( giuseppe andrews ) , trip ( james debello ) , and jam ( sam huntington ) . they have a garage band . they \\' re pathetic , like all garage bands , but they like kiss and they like rock n \\' roll , so i guess that means we root for them . they have tickets , they lose them . they get more tickets , they lose those too . they come up with crazy schemes to get tickets , most of which backfire . there \\' s not much more to it . frankly , it becomes a little less than exciting to see them try to get kiss tickets about halfway through the film , when a total of eight tickets have already graced the boys \\' hands , only to be lost because of their sheer stupidity . oh , and jam ( real name jeremiah ) has a really , really annoying ultra - religious mother who ought to be reported to the child welfare agency . she doesn \\' t want them to see kiss , if you hadn \\' t figured that out already . it \\' s really quite disheartening to see such a fine soundtrack go to waste in a pointless movie like this . we \\' ve got plenty of kiss , along with some ac / dc , ramones , and thin lizzy . then again , \" maximum overdrive \" had an awesome soundtrack ( me being the big ac / dc fan that i am ) , but is probably one of the worst movies of all time . \" detroit rock city \" doesn \\' t quite reach that level of ineptitude , but it gets dangerously close . in fact , the music is the only thing that keeps this movie from being a complete failure in my mind . basically , the soundtrack has earned the film a full half - star , which means all the bands involved can pat themselves on the back ( except for marilyn manson , whose half - hearted cover of ac / dc \\' s \" highway to hell \" sounds like something my neighbor \\' s cat coughed up ) . it \\' s also really sad to see the talents of the cast go to waste , because it \\' s evident that they \\' re all trying really hard to squeeze some life out of this dead turkey of a movie . edward furlong has done far better work than this , and so has natasha lyonne , and so has lin shaye , but hey , they \\' ve got to make a living in hollywood . people wanting to see kiss , and lots of it will probably be disappointed , considering the band appears for about five minutes and plays one song . too bad , they might have provided some energy to this mess . director adam rifkin knows he hasn \\' t got much material to work with , so he takes a chapter from the michael bay book of directing and keeps his camera spinning . we get an endless parade of quick - cuts , split - screens , zoom - outs , zoom - ins , and rotating cameras , all in an effort to cover up the sheer stupidity of the script . it \\' s fun for a while , but eventually it becomes disorienting . i would recommend that those who felt seasick at \" the blair witch project \" stay far away from \" detroit rock city , \" because the witch has got nothing on this baby . i haven \\' t felt such an urge to reach out and hold the camera still since \" armageddon . \" and what about that script ? it \\' s written by carl j . dupr ? , which sounds like as made - up a name as i \\' ve ever heard . if it is , i can \\' t say i blame the writer for distancing himself as far from this script as possible . a plotless , pointless rock n \\' roll movie can be fun , if the jokes and gags are actually funny . the jokes in \" detroit rock city \" rarely are . in fact , the only time i really laughed was when a priest gets stoned on a marijuana - laced pizza , and that was just because it was so surreal . the rest of the movie just seems like they just threw a bunch of vulgar stuff up on screen and called it \" comedy . \" there is no set - up , just a succession of punchlines that don \\' t provide for much in the way of chuckles , precisely because there was no set - up . it \\' s as if they just whacked someone on the head , pointed at him and said , \" see ? funny ! \" look , that woman was so shocked by hearing loud kiss music that she spilled her drink . see ? funny ! look , that guy just got clocked by a telephone receiver . twice . see ? funny ! look , that kid has been vomiting for 20 minutes after drinking an inordinate amount of alcohol and is now about to perform an exotic dance for money . see ? funny ! a word of advice to mr . dupr ? : no , these things aren \\' t funny all by themselves . they must be preceded by a clever set - up so the audience hasn \\' t predicted them five minutes in advance . that \\' s it , i \\' ve said enough about this movie . it \\' s a waste of time and money . i liked the music , but don \\' t bother buying the soundtrack . i hear it \\' s just modern bands doing inferior versions of the songs that are actually in the movie . you want to see this concept executed well ?

       " ('in roger michell \\' s romantic comedy notting hill , william thacker ( hugh grant ) leads a rather dreary life maintaining his flagging travel bookshop in the quaint section of london which lends it \\' s name to the film \\' s title . one day , american movie superstar anna scott ( julia roberts ) walks in to purchase a book on turkey . quickly enamored of each other , the two embark upon an on - again , off - again love affair replete with romance , humor , and the occasional lump in the throat . the film opens with a non - verbal cue to anna \\' s stardom as the title credits appear over a montage of slow motion sequences featuring the actress \\' s appearances in films and at premieres - coming out of limousines , walking the red carpets and such . without words , this sequence gives us a background to her character . following , however , is a set - up narration by william indicating what he does and where he lives . i don \\' t know why the filmmakers chose to go with a narration which tells us nothing we couldn \\' t have figured out by watching the first ten minutes of film , and which never resurfaces after the movie \\' s beginning , but there it is . if there were ever a clear case for \" less is more , \" this would be it . the film is told nearly first person from william \\' s point of view , as he is in every scene . by nature of this arrangement , we get a very definite sense of what he is all about , and his nice guy personality wins us over easily . in fact , much of notting hill \\' s strength lies in the great dialog written for this character by richard curtis . a scene where william is still in shock over the fact that he \\' s even talking to a silver screen goddess is made golden by the way bumbles through his attempt to offer her some honey - soaked apricots from his refrigerator . or take an instance where anna kisses william and asks him never to tell anyone for fear of the incident hurting her image . william assures her he wouldn \\' t say a word , then adds , \" well , i \\' ll probably tell myself now and then , but i \\' d never believe it . \" great stuff . the downside to spending so much time with william is that we don \\' t get to see enough of anna to make their relationship whole and plausible . we \\' re constantly exposed to william \\' s thoughts , feelings , actions and desires , but don \\' t actually get the sense of how much anna really feels for him . there are a couple of instances where she declares her obvious interest , but they nearly come out of nowhere due to the fact that we \\' re not sure what she \\' s been thinking all the times in between . this , combined with the sheer iniquity of screen time between the two , makes this hugh grant \\' s film hands down . he gets the great scenes ( look for one in which he has to portray an interviewer from horse and hound magazine in order to speak with anna ) , the great lines , and gives an overall wonderful performance . julia roberts fans will probably be disappointed by the actress \\' s top billing and subsequent lack of involvement in the film ( ala sandra bullock in a time to kill ) along with her detached performance which is only worsened by her character \\' s unpredictable behavior . anna doesn \\' t get a lot of our compassion . this romantic comedy leans a little more toward the comedy than the romance , much of it supplied by grant himself , but with considerable help from the supporting cast . most notable is rhys ifans as spike , william \\' s eccentric roommate , who is in the film for no other purpose than to make us laugh . hugh bonneville , emma chambers , james dreyfus , and gina mckee bring up the guard as william \\' s friends and family , particularly shining in a scene where william brings anna to his sister \\' s birthday dinner , and we get to see how these common folks react to the presence of a movie star in their midst . it \\' s a scene most of us will probably think would play out in our own living rooms were we faced with a similar situation . roger michell \\' s use of visuals doesn \\' t sweep us off our feet , but does give us more than your typical movie of this type . for example , there are a couple of instances in this film where large amounts of time pass . whereas some films are content to simply put in a caption saying \" eight months later , \" michell presents us with more interesting cues , such as william \\' s walk though his neighborhood while the seasons change around him . another memorable shot occurs in a park where the camera is lifted from ground level to a couple of hundred feet in the air . we \\' re generally used to scenes where our point of view is lifted from the earth to treetop level or so , but in this case , the camera just keeps going up and up until we have a bird \\' s eye view of the ground below . music is used rather glaringly as an enhancement to many of the film \\' s scenes , and some of this might have been better toned down , but in other areas it works to full effect . it \\' s kind of a mixed bag , but still fares better than many of today \\' s lighthearted movies which are so influenced by the mtv fare that the film becomes one long music video . at least this film has some pretty good music that for the most part remains relevant and appropriate . notting hill \\' s grant and roberts will not go down in history as one of the all - time greatest film pairings , but the chemistry is decent and the comedic aspects of the movie more than make up for it . for a couple of hours , you should expect to laugh more than cry , and that \\' s not so bad , now is it ?',\n",

       " ('in essence , good will hunting is an ordinary story told well . taken as a whole , there \\' s little that \\' s special about this tale -- it follows a traditional narrative path , leaves the audience with a warm , fuzzy feeling , and never really challenges or surprises us . but it \\' s intelligently written ( with dialogue that is occasionally brilliant ) , strongly directed , and nicely acted . so , while good will hunting is far from a late - year masterpiece , it \\' s a worthwhile sample of entertainment . like scent of a woman , which was released around this time of the season five years ago , good will hunting is about the unlikely friendship that develops between a world - weary veteran and a cocky young man . the formula for the two films is similar -- both of the principals learn from each other as they slowly break down their barriers on the way to a better understanding of life and their place in it -- but the characters are different . al pacino \\' s slade was a larger - than - life individual ; robin williams \\' sean mcguire is much more subtle . and matt damon \\' s will hunting uses pugnaciousness to supplant the blandness of chris o \\' donnell \\' s charlie . will is a troubled individual . as a child , he was the frequent victim of abuse . an orphan , he was in and out of foster homes on a regular basis . now , not yet 21 years old , he has accumulated an impressive rap sheet . he has a short temper and any little incident can set him off like a spark in a tinder box . but he \\' s a mathematical genius with a photographic memory and the ability to conceive simple solutions to complex problems . while working as a janitor at mit , he delights in anonymously proving theorems on the math building \\' s hall blackboards . then , one evening , his anonymity is shattered when professor lambeau ( stellan skarsgard ) catches him at work . will flees , but lambeau tracks him down . unfortunately , by the time the professor finds him , will is in jail for assaulting a police offer . the judge agrees to release will under two conditions : that he spend one day a week meeting with lambeau and that he spend one day a week meeting with a therapist . eventually , once several psychologists have rejected the belligerent young man , sean mcguire , a teacher at bunker hill community college , agrees to take the case . after a rocky start , the two form a rapport and will begins to explore issues and emotions he had walled up behind impregnable armor . and , as will advances his self - awareness in sessions with sean , he also learns about friendship from his buddy , chuckie ( ben affleck ) , and love from a harvard co - ed named skylar ( minnie driver ) . the script , by co - stars matt damon and ben affleck , is not a groundbreaking piece of literature , and occasionally resorts to shameless manipulation . the characters are well - developed , however , and there are times when the dialogue positively sparkles . at one point , will comments that a session with sean is turning into a \" taster \\' s choice moment . \" later , will gives a brilliant , breathless diatribe against the nsa that has the rhythm of something written by kevin smith . ( note : since smith co - executive produced good will hunting , it \\' s not out of the question that he had some input into this scene . ) director gus van sant ( drugstore cowboy , to die for ) culls genuine emotion from his actors , and this results in several affecting and powerful scenes . there \\' s an edginess to some of the sean / will therapy sessions , and the offscreen chemistry between matt damon and minnie driver ( who became romantically linked while making this film ) translates effectively to the movie -- the will / skylar relationship is electric . likewise , the companionability of damon and affleck is apparent in the easygoing nature of will and chuckie \\' s friendship . many of the individual scenes are strong enough to earn good will hunting a recommendation , even if the overall story is somewhat generic . matt damon , who recently starred as the idealistic young lawyer in the rainmaker , is solid ( although not spectacular ) as will . minnie driver ( last seen in grosse pointe blank ) adds another strong performance to a growing resume ( and it \\' s refreshing that she was allowed to keep her british accent rather than having to attempt an american one ) . the outstanding performance of the film belongs to robin williams , whose sean is sad and wise , funny and somber . arguably the best dramatic work in the actor \\' s career ( alongside what he did in the fisher king ) , williams \\' portrayal could earn him a best supporting actor oscar nomination . adequate support is provided by ben affleck ( chasing amy ) and stellan skarsgard ( breaking the waves ) . like most of what comes before it , the ending of good will hunting is completely predictable . but meeting expectations and following a familiar path aren \\' t always bad things in a movie , provided the film accomplishes those goals with a modicum of style and an attention to detail . good will hunting does both , and , as a result , earns a rating commensurate with the \" good \" in the title .',\n",

       " ('starting with the little mermaid and most recently the lion king , the walt disney company once again proved that they could not only consistently make modern day animated classics , but were particularly in touch with what the general viewing public -- particularly kids -- wanted to see . therefore , it \\' s with some surprise that as a big fan of the above mentioned movies i was so disappointed with pocahontas . despite some innovation and risk taking , the story is surprisingly straightforward and dramatized in broad strokes , as are its characters . a group of englishmen lead by the evil governor ratcliffe come to the new world in search of gold with no regard for the \" savages \" that live there . the natives look upon the english with just as much fear and distrust . only the love between the beautifully structured pocahontas and the dashing captain john smith can prevent a terrible clash . the ending , as it turns out , is not entirely a happy one and is one of the film \\' s finer moments . the characters are mixtures of stereotypes and lack any real depth . governor ratcliffe , for instance , is a snobbish , single - minded bore whose mere appearance is supposed to bring about hisses . captain john smith is a blond hunk who , while \" slightly \" misguided , is good at heart . pocahontas herself is the typical disney heroine who is practically being forced to marry a man who everyone but her likes and finds the man of her dreams just in time . she even comes complete with insignificant best friend . again , against tradition , talking animals aren \\' t used , but a lusty , wizened , talking tree is . this is an odd compromise , but it \\' s one of the few elements that really work . the animals are a delight , and what brief time their interactions take place brings the only humor and fun to a rather bland presentation . maybe it would have been a better film if we saw the story unfold through their eyes . the talking tree , who seems to have a thing for john smith , is the only other character that can hold our interest and is perhaps the best developed of the bunch . the music , a welcome delight in the later disney films , is mostly a let down here , with the exception of the catchy and motivational , \" colors of the wind . \" mel gibson , as the voice of john smith , has a solid singing voice and should have been used more . the opposite holds true for the governor ratcliffe led songs ; the singing is even more grating than his simplistic character . i was rather bored through what turned out to be a shorter than expected running time . even the children in the audience seemed restless . while there \\' s no stopping a kid from seeing something that they want -- or disney wants them to -- most i believe will be disappointed . perhaps the biggest problem is that disney has strayed from their familiar fable and fairy tale themes to history . it \\' s all right to change or embellish fantasy to suit a movie \\' s entertainment value , but doing so to historical facts doesn \\' t work nearly as well as creating nagging questions in the viewer \\' s minds and plot holes that are never filled . even the artwork , another disney strong point , varies greatly in quality , making any story problems even more obvious . as mentioned above , there were many questions that stayed with me while viewing the film . for instance , if john smith was truly such a world traveler and had so much experience with \" savages , \" why did he so quickly change his previous \" kill as many indians as i can \" attitude . if he was such a nice guy after all , he should have changed his ways long before this . or how about pocahontas \\' amazing english speaking ability when this had supposedly been the first time she had seen white men ? i can understand making the native americans speak english for the benefit of the audience , but simply saying that they had met a missionary years earlier would have cleared up a lot ; history was modified in the film anyway . as it is , i wonder if it doesn \\' t give kids the wrong impression . in short , the film is too simplistic for adults and contains too much romance and not enough action or humor for the younger set . while disney tried valiantly in many ways to break with some of their firmest traditions , they end up failing on too many levels .',\n",

       " ('showgirls is the second major outing for the production team of pual verhoeven , director , and joe eszterhas , writer . their last effort , basic instinct , played like the most sumptuous of classic hitchcock , with a dash of raw sex and sensuality that made it come across with a hit like curry - spiced tabasco sauce ; a dish not to everyone \\' s taste , but certainly a well - crafted movie . possibly that movie \\' s greatest strength was that the most important events happened offstage , prior to the movie , during the movie , and after the movie . . . and that , after bringing all the plotlines together neatly , it left the viewer with full knowledge of what * would * happen in the characters \\' future , so there was no need to film it . there was actually about four hours \\' worth of screen story there , but eszterhas found ways to get it all on - screen in two , by leading his audience into analyzing what was really going on ; and by still holding their interest with clever misdirection and false trails . the major elements that made basic instinct work so well are present in showgirls . we have attractive , sympathetic , but still highly repellent characters ; we have shows for the eyes and the ears , plotlines that play on several levels , we have beautifully delineated characters who are drawn from life and very believable , and we have a story of an innocent ( who may not be so innocent ) who \\' s trying to play straight , trying to improve her station in life , who slips into behaving the way those around her do . . . but recovers with a flourish , and quits a winner . in this sense , the movie is a bit of a departure for verhoeven , who \\' s not known for treating his characters well ; but nomi , the part played by elizabeth berkley , definitely opts out of the game in a positive way , and we \\' re left feeling good about her future . this is not one of the great movies , but it \\' s far better than we \\' d been led to expect by all the negative pre - release publicity . verhoeven got his first oscar nomination in 1971 , and in the last quarter - century has pushed farther and farther , experimenting with the socially - acceptable limits to movie - making . his most recent three movies , robocop , total recall , and basic instinct , have been a progression of back - door access to american culture , moving from the fantastic through the merely psychotic to the underlying basic drives ; and now he \\' s exploring the sleeze . this movie may be the first movie ever made for which the director \\' s contract contained a specific provision that he would not have to deliver an r rated movie . ( verhoeven had to cut several parts of basic instinct to get an r rating , although his original version is available on video . ) many reviewers have taken the politically - correct stance that any movie which uses naked ladies as scenery is a bad thing ; but they miss the fact that this movie is not about naked ladies , it \\' s about people in an environment where naked ladies are common , and why such an environment should exist . it \\' s about the scum who use other people as power - trip toys , and the need to escape their power . it \\' s about a world where sex is nothing and normal human values don \\' t pertain ; and the lack of sexual excitement and passionate heat in even the most blatant scenes is something of an accomplishment . an nc - 17 movie which isn \\' t sexually exciting says a great deal about the phoniness and emptiness of a social stratum where sex has been robbed of any kind of beauty , power , or value . the one scene in the movie that * could * have been a good sex scene , berkley and maclachlan in a swimming pool , is not exciting , because by then we already know his character is a callous manipulator . if anything , it \\' s a rape scene with a victim who \\' s been duped into cooperation . you don \\' t make a movie about the history of black people in america without using a few black actors ; you don \\' t make a movie about world war ii without a few guns going off and a few people getting killed ; and you don \\' t make a movie about las vegas showgirls without showing a few las vegas showgirls . . . and in an awful lot of vegas shows , an awful lot of ladies wear very little clothing . this is a legitimate portrayal of a rather seamy side of the entertainment industry , in a town where sex is simply a negotiable commodity . showgirls de - glamorizes the las vegas show and sex industries with great effectiveness . nomi is played , in a very good performance , by elizabeth berkley , who gives us a solid picture of a woman with limited talents who \\' s at the end of her rope , desperate to live a life better than the one she \\' s known . she has nothing to market except her body and her limited dancing ability , and is trying desperately not to to be a hooker , trying to be something better than she seems destined to be . when nomi realizes she \\' s gone too far for too little , she catches herself just in time to save the most essential part of who she wants to be . gina rivera plays molly , a dressmaker and costumer who befriends nomi , providing her with what may be the one solid , positive relationship in nomi \\' s entire life . molly is the one who makes the difference , and provides the role model and framework nomi needs to verify the value system she \\' ll be using for the rest of her life , and nomi \\' s feelings for molly are the spur that forces nomi \\' s decision . gina gershon plays cristal , an aging , but still very attractive starring dancer , a reflexively competitive manipulator who \\' s become a villainess by internalizing the ethos of the crooks and scum around her . gershon plays cristal as a cross between ava gardner and raquel welch ; a fading talent made bitter by self - awareness . her character is very well drawn and performed ; in a major scene in a hospital room , she acknowledges what she is , and , in essence , passes the torch to nomi . the relationship between the two of them is the most honest one in the movie , and provides part of the impetus nomi needs to follow a different path . it is no accident that the three important parts in this movie are women of different stripe ; molly is an honest , hard - working person who means well , and nearly dies because she confuses the glitter and the image with reality . cristal is a talented dancer who \\' s compromised her ideals and sold herself to be a co - operating part of the system , exchanging self - respect for the species of stardom that can be had in las vegas . nomi believes she can make it without selling herself , succumbs to a degree , and then realizes she can make it without selling herself , and doesn \\' t need las vegas or its brand of \" stardom . \" the male parts in this movie are simply props ; they exist only to demonstrate and explicate the cultural milieu against which showgirls exist . kyle maclachlan , whose single best previous work was as an inhumanly emotionless cop in the hidden , gives us a nicely reptilian bit of pond scum on two legs , camouflaged as a nice guy . glenn plummer plays a dancer who \\' s working as a bellboy , and provides a bit of alternate perspective . plummer \\' s character is the only one in the movie who \\' s maintaining an interest in dance as a performing art , but even he \\' s succumbed to the cult of manipulation . plummer \\' s character is the closest thing to a sympathetic male character in the whole movie . some of jost vacano \\' s cinematography is fantastic , and one particular delineation of nomi \\' s character alteration , a no - dialog scene using nothing but color changes in the lighting , is utterly terrifying . this movie is rated nc - 17 due to language , sexual situations , full frontal nudity , violence , and probably the costuming as well . i don \\' t see a way this particular story could have been told well without it , and i regard it as a legitimate exercise in movie - making . but don \\' t go see it if you \\' re not in a tough mood ; the only person it \\' s possible to like in this movie ends up in an i . c . u . on life support , and there is probably not one character in this movie you \\' d enjoy meeting in person .',\n",

( term used as loosely as possible ) survival instincts and a good dose of common sense seems to suggest grabbing the shotgun , which our hero does , but only after contemplating it for about thirty seconds . even when he does grab it he seems unsure how to hold it , going so far as to actually wonder if he should place a finger near the trigger . mind you , i \\' ve never fired a shotgun in my life but believe you me that the bad guy would be missing most of his vital organs , be he stoned or not . some will argue that our hero does not have a killer instinct , the hell with that ! two fbi guys have just been shot in front me , along with one bad guy and the other looks like he might go ballistic at any second . solution ? boom ! i \\' ll take the time to feel sorry about it later thank you very much . another prime example of the idiot hero syndrome : our boy duchovny needs to reach his girl before something bad happens to her . he knows the head bad guy has her on the tenth floor of a building and that he might be running into a room full of people with itchy trigger fingers . he still has his shotgun , bring it along you say ? no thanks , i \\' ll just ditch it in the back of my car . and the real kicker is this : when he reaches the room and people start shooting at him he has the nerve to look surprised ! while we are on the subject of getting shot , why in hades were those fbi guys sitting with their backs to the door ? i \\' ve got no formal training but even i know you never sit with your back to the door . ask mr . wild bill , the first and only time he did not sit with his back to a wall cost him his life . this is the major problem with this movie , any mook could have thought of a hundred ways to make it better . is it so much to ask that hollywood actually put a little common sense into their characters ? for instance : our heroes hide at duchovny \\' s summer home , now the bad guys could come knocking at any moment . ok , this time our hero does get himself a gun and has it at his side most of the time . but see , our hero is a drug addict and guess what ? he chooses now to go clean and suffer through dt . oh sure , he \\' ll be really impressive when the bad guys come calling . going clean is really honorable of him , but i would have waited until i did not need to be conscious or being able to fire a gun . for an enjoyable performance by timothy hutton , plot holes the size of godzilla , getting our intelligence insulted and several \" oh come on ! \" moments .',\n",

( notice the frequent use of the word stereotypical . this film uses a lot of formula , the plot is basically known from the opening credits . ) so what is good about the movie ? well as i said there are a few amusing moments . surprisingly , julie brown , who i usually find just plain goofy , was the best thing in the film . also there are several very funny sequences involving analysis of the human mating ritual . gee , this is really short . not much to say about the film really . it is just kind of there . watching it on video might not be a complete waste of time , but i wouldn ' t recommend hiring a baby sitter or spending a lot of money to see it at the theatre .\",\n",

       " ('according to hollywood movies made in last few decades , life in small town is one of the worst things that could happen to a human being . even worse fate awaits those who were unfortunate to grow up in those dark , god - forsaken places and later forced to live forever traumatised by the experience . on the other hand , it seems that something more than atlantic ocean divides europe from america , because one of the most popular and beloved european films takes exactly the opposite view . this film is amarcord , 1974 comedy by famous italian director federico fellini , which later gave inspiration to numerous imitations and homages , and even led few american screen artists to adopt its heretical views about benefits of small town life . the film is based on the screenplay by fellini and tonino guerra and it lacks the plot in usual sense . instead we follow one year in 1930s italian summer resort town of rimini through the series of short vignettes that depict various local events and customs , as well as series of local , often very colourful characters . although many of those characters occasionally take the role of narrator , movie concentrates on its nominal protagonist , 14 - year old boy titta ( played by bruno zanin ) and chronicles his sexual frustrations , obsession with local beauty queen named gradisca ( played by magali noel ) , problems in his lovingly dysfunctional family , as well as troubles his father ( played by armando brancia ) have with mussolini \\' s fascist regime . amarcord was often noted as the ultimate nostalgia film , and it probably explains why it is very popular , even among those people who actually don \\' t like federico fellini \\' s work very much . every member of its potential audience would find part of himself or herself in this film , because fellini in this film clearly illustrates natural human desire to paint past in the best way possible . distortion between actual past and its subjective interpretation could be found even in the title of the film - word \" amarcord \" is nothing more than badly pronounced phrase \" i remember \" in local italian dialect . in the same way the word is distorted , so is the past in memories of those who remember it . after the premiere , fellini rejected any claims about autobiographical character of this film , but it doesn \\' t matter whether rimini of amarcord actually resembles rimini of fellini \\' s childhood or not ; any place and any time could resemble characters and situations of this film . fellini \\' s views on nostalgia are clearly illustrated with a way he mixes reality and fantasy in this film . even the most naturalistic scenes are laced with dark humour and grotesque images . characters look like caricatures , actors playing them often deliberately overact , and women , especially those who fuel titta \\' s sexual fantasies , often have certain body parts with gargantuan proportions . every now and then , scenes that depict 1930s reality gradually slide into fantasies of movie \\' s characters and rimini becomes almost indistinguishable from the magical place in characters \\' visions . because of that , almost everything in this film looks different , and in most cases better , than it would have looked in the real life . even the fascism gets fellinian make - over - fellini views mussolini \\' s totalitarian regime as nothing more than visual spectacle ( explaining why similar regimes enjoyed such popular support throughout history ) and opportunity for comedy . when fascists finally show their true colours and begin torturing their opponents , even this becomes opportunity for scenes of macabre humour . unlike many of his italian colleagues in 1970s , who had used 1930s period setting to explicitly condemn fascism and serve fashionable political agenda , fellini doesn \\' t care that much about politics . lack of self - righteous moral perspective is compensated with fellini \\' s humanistic approach to his characters . each of them , regardless of age , gender , social class or physical appearance , is given opportunity to express his or her views , dreams and fears . fellini treats all those characters with warmth and affection , even when he paints them as grotesque caricatures of real people . because of this warmth and democratic spirit , amarcord could be viewed as one of the most humane films of 20th century , and it keeps its general feel good atmosphere despite depicting having many uncomfortable , melancholic and even tragic moments . fellini couldn \\' t produce such effects without using his own directorial talent that gave a very personal touch to this movie . vignettes aren \\' t memorable because of the characters only ; fellini uses camera , painting film in bright colours , especially in the scenes that depict character \\' s fantasies . fellini also knows how to use locations , whether such location happens to be luxurious hotel , bright - coloured beach or rural countryside . even the down - to - earth streets of rimini , where everyone knows everyone , gets magical dimension during the snowfall . on the other hand , lack of credible special effects somewhat diminished the same effect during the ocean liner scene . this atmosphere is also provided by incredible talent of composer and fellini \\' s long - time associate nino rota . his amarcord theme is probably one of the most recognisable , most popular and most relaxing and uplifting pieces of film music ever produced . that music alone should be the reason to view amarcord as one of the indisputable classics of seventh art .',\n",

( special note to x - philes : mith pilleggi , the actor who plays ad skinner in the x - files , could be seen in a small role of cannery lab foreman ) .\",\n",

       " ('the most interesting part of \" can \\' t hardly wait \" just happens to be not only the most human , but for many of us , the one part that many of us can easily relate to . that is the character of denise ( lauren ambrose ) , the film \\' s sole sarcastic member who mocks everything that goes on in the film , and at one point sits down on a couch and looks totally bored . the film wisely holds over this moment , nicely showing her alienation in the midst of a large high school party . . . almost too nicely . for some members of the audience ( read : me ) , this is basically a mirror of what \\' s going on with them watching this film . we sit there wondering why we \\' ve even bothered to see a film about a long high school party we probably never felt the desire to go to in the first place . i would actually highly recommend this film if it satirized all of this . after all , this film is filled with a bunch of pathetic stereotypes much of which i went to high school with . everyone \\' s here : the jock , the homecoming queen , the nerd ( and his dominions of trekkies and x - philes ) , the alienated wannabe writer , the school spirit girl , the pothead ( s ) , the wigger , etc , etc , etc , and weirdly enough this film shows them as superficial , lame , and basically as a bunch of losers . except for denise , who rolls her eyes at everything , and easily becomes the most likable character even before she speaks ( her yearbook entry , something which is done for each main character , quotes oscar wilde - definite pointers there ) . unfortunately , the writers and directors take several major misteps on the way to making this into an admirable and even likable film . the film , as i said , portrays most of its characters as superficial and just totally ignorant to everything . however , instead of sticking with this , perhaps even going a bit further with it , they let this lie , and actually make these characters into our heroes . we follow several of them , all a bunch of moronic stereotypes with only a shread of humanity and realism , and tries to tell boring and overly melodramatic tales about them as if we actually cared and / or identified with them . and if we did , we certainly don \\' t want to revisit that state of being . here \\' s a quick low - down : it \\' s graduation , and we follow a bunch of seniors on the last night , otherwise known as the \" american grafitti \" or , to a lesser extent , the \" dazed and confused \" cliche . the formal just followed them as they drove aimlessly ; the latter did a little bit of that and featured a big outdoor keg party . \" can \\' t hardly wait \" just opts for a big indoor keg party , and a little bit of aimless driving , albeit of the i \\' m - whining - because - i - can \\' t - get - a - girl - i - want brand . we follow many people around , but mostly we trail preston ( ethan embry , of \" that thing you do ! \" ) , the alienated writer , who \\' s been pining over the homcoming queen , amanda ( the totally overrated jennifer love hewitt ) , for the entirety of high school because he thinks they shared a moment their freshman year over a freaking pop tart . now that she \\' s broken up with her football player boyfriend , mike ( peter facinelli ) , he decides to go to the party with a note he \\' s written declaring his \" love \" for her in the hopes he \\' ll build up the guts to give it to her . . . even though he \\' s leaving for a multi - week intensive writing program hosted by none other than kurt vonnegut ( okay : the ingenius vonnegut or some icky noxema spokesperson ? ) . since that plot is incredibly lame and a track record of what goes on with it wouldn \\' t be able to carry a commercial let alone a feature film , and because it \\' s a party , there are some more main characters , such as : william ( charlie korsmo , finally surfacing after \" dick tracy \" ) , the nerd ( and his dominions ) who has come up with a ridiculous plan to publically sabotage mike , who \\' s humiliated him for years , but gets too caught up in drinking to do it ; kenny ( seth green ) , the wigger , who has decided that this party will be where he will finally get laid ( uh huh ) ; and denise , the only exceptional character , who unfortunately gets stuck in a bathroom ( don \\' t ask ) with kenny where the two characters let down their characters and are allowed to follow the laws of plot cliches from point a to point b with nary a bit of characterization involved after awhile . ugh . the main comparison this film is getting to another film is actually not \" american grafitti \" or \" dazed and confused , \" two films that embraced and ultimately made humans out of many of its high schoolers ( not to mention were extremely entertaining ) , but to john hughes films of the 80s , most notably \" sixteen candles . \" the big difference in the two is that that film managed to not only embrace but even satirize its main characters , and did so equally and in an entertaining fashion . this film forgets to satirize its characters , and ultimately tells a story about a bunch of uninteresting stereotypes . . . and then says that it \\' s all okay . we can \\' t take this film seriously , nor can we take this as fun , so really what good is it ? but i will tell you some things i did like : i liked the direction , except for a couple too - over - the - top features , like way - too - glossy jump cuts ( it \\' s like an oxymoron ) and other obscurities . generally , though , elfont and kaplan do have graceful camera movement , and even manage to capture an altman - esque feel to their film from time to time ( a thing with a note , though , is too hokey to really be admirable ) . i actually did like seth green , for once in about a decade ( when he played a very young woody allen in \" radio days \" ) - his desintegration of his wigger character was almost believable . . . almost . and , of course , lauren ambrose is wonderful as denise , the one character we could have used some more of , even though it would have changed the entirety of the film . however , the character of denise really doesn \\' t work with the film , when really thought about . she \\' s far too witty and realized ( at least for the first half ) to belong in this film , and whenever she appears , she automatically gives everything a delightfully satirical tone . she \\' s not just the cynic or the intellectual ; she \\' s just a very interesting character who provides entertainment even if it further damages other already damaged characters . she may ruin the film more , but at least when she \\' s on screen we can sit up and think to ourselves \" well , at least we \\' ll be entertained . \" a couple other things that just don \\' t work : mike \\' s character , who suffers an epiphany throughout the film but in the end acts as though he has forgotten everything : too much the sacrificial lamb for the film in general ; the aimless , bitchy driving by preston to try and get over his inability to shack up with amanda - give me a break ; and perhaps the one thing that just doesn \\' t work at all : jenna eflman \\' s uncredited cameo as an angel - just didn \\' t work , but nice try . basically the worst thing about this film , the real reason i \\' m giving this such a low rating , is because it refuses to give us any fully realized characters and then insists we follow around complete stereotypes from other movies doing things that are inane and unlike anything we \\' d do . we don \\' t feel for these characters because for most of us , we aren \\' t stereotypes going through the motions to worn subplots . the acid test for high school movies is : does it at all capture the feel of what it \\' s portraying ? the answer for this film is no . nice try , though .',\n",

       " ('a disappointing biography about the homosexual relationship of two famous 19th century french poets . the film managed to remove all the poetry from the poets and instead concentrated on their abrasive personalities . the result is merely an academic exercise , leaving an emotional vacuum that it couldn \\' t build on to show them as the poets they were . on paper , this shouldn \\' t have been so terrible -- it had a talented director in agnieszka holland ( \" the secret garden \" ) , a proven screenwriter in christopher hampton ( dangerous liaisons ) , and a capable cast . but the film was done in by its inept script , the unappealing way the film was directed , and the miscasting of leonardo dicaprio as rimbaud . i found his performance to be the most risible one in the film , with him acting more like a teenage brat than a young genius , spouting obsenities without giving a hint that a true poet lies behind that facade . he , especially , looked bad because david thewlis as paul verlaine looked so good despite the turgid dialogue that was thrust upon him and how thin a character he was forced to be . but when the two of them were together , it looked like a mismatch . leonardo \\' s rimbaud only made the young poet look petulant and crude , yet we know from rimbaud \\' s poetry , that he must have had something going for him because his poetry was awe inspiring . the film opens in post - revolutionary france in 1871 , the 16 - year - old rimbaud has sent the established symbolist poet verlaine a letter with his poems . he accepts verlaine \\' s praises and invitation to be a house guest in his splendid paris home , and rimbaud leaves his sullen farm in rural charleville . once there , rimbaud is disappointed in the bourgeoisie household , has an immediate conflict with verlaine \\' s busty 18 - year - old wife mathilde ( romane ) , and finds to his regret that the drunken verlaine loves his rich wife for her body and that he lives off her family \\' s money , even though he has nothing else in common with her . when verlaine states , \" poets can learn from one another , \" rimbaud replies in a haughty tone , \" only if they \\' re bad poets . \" he will continue to treat the older poet like dirt for the rest of their relationship . verlaine proves to be weak - willed , beating his wife regularly , and plays just as despicable a character as rimbaud . when mathilde \\' s father kicks rimbaud out of the house , verlaine finds him in a rooming house and the two become lovers . it \\' s a real downer to watch this story unfold into a series of obnoxious behavior patterns on the part of the two poets , which leads them to traveling together and mathilde asking for a divorce . in brussels , verlaine gets arrested for sodomy and spends two years in jail . while rimbaud becomes angered at the literary world and never writes another poem after he becomes 19 . he instead goes to north africa and becomes an adventurer and a gun - runner , and after ten years there , comes home with a tumor on his knee and dies a changed man at the age of 37 . the hopeless relationship between the two is what the picture covers in detail and that was not very satisfying . the film ends on a whimper . . . with verlaine talking with rimbaud \\' s sister about her brother and the poems of his he still possesses , which the sister wants destroyed so as not to embarrass the family or ruin the name of her deceased brother if published . this film was especially annoying because rimbaud \\' s poems are filled with a visionary tenseness that are not even approached in this film , as the film only manages to skim the surface of the lives of these poets and completely ignores the value of their poetry . i have no idea what the filmmaker was trying to say in this film , but whatever it was , it just didn \\' t work . it certainly didn \\' t bring any light into understanding what rimbaud meant to modern poetry and why he earned the reputation as the so - called father of modern poetry .',\n",

       " ('satirical films usually fall into one of two categories : 1 ) long - term satire where everything , including the jokes , is somehow related on a large scale ( i . e . \" dr . strangelove \" ; 2 ) situation satire in which the comedy and themes are derived moment by moment and scene by scene ( i . e . \" men in black \" ) . what \\' s unique about \" wag the dog \" is that it doesn \\' t necessarily fit either of these descriptions , and yet is both at the same time . the result is a clever comedy based on an original , smart premise , even if the focus does tend to wander a bit . if there \\' s anything that affects americans the most it \\' s politics and showbusiness . in this age of information and technology , we \\' ve been so conditioned by the media and the entertainment industry in our ways of perceiving things , it \\' s gotten to the point that we are practically controlled by it . we need the media to bring us the most up - to - date news , but we also need the escapism of hollywood to counter all that thinking . this film starts off well by quickly establishing these ideas , and then presents an interesting scenario : if politics , the media coverage of politics , and the entertainment industry are so closely related , couldn \\' t someone with the power and authority to manipulate one of the aspects manipulate them all ? that \\' s the idea conrad brean ( de niro ) , a professional washington spin doctor , comes up with in order to restore the president \\' s good name who has been accused of child molestation just weeks before the election . brean , along with the president \\' s top advisor , winifred ames ( heche ) , fly to california to meet up with hot - shot movie producer stanley motss ( hoffman ) . they pitch him an idea to \" produce \" the image of a war with albania ( it \\' s a country no one \\' s heard of so they people will buy it ) . soon the wheels are in motion and the film \\' s riffing satire comes into play . we \\' re inundated with the hollywood mind set as motss brings in a number of experts to help manage the situation , such as a folk singer , visual and sound effects technicians , and a modern style expert known as the fad king ( leary ) . the initial atmosphere is rich with numerous pop culture references where everything somehow relates to something on tv , in the movies , or in the news . the characters \\' dialogue is witty and funny , although some of the actual jokes and gags seem rather sitcom - esque . for example , one scene shows motss and brean \\' s production crew filming an actress portraying a poor albanian refugee . motss ordered a kitten for the girl to carry , but instead wound up with a dozen different dogs . since it \\' s all computer - enhanced anyway , she ends up cradling a bag of tostitos with the kitten to be inserted later . this demonstrates the film \\' s ability to take a relatively ordinary situation and make it smart and funny just through the premise . but then there \\' s the gags and one - liners that , although are humorous , seem a little gratuitious in the long run such as motss not being able to remember the actress \\' s name , or , whenever a problem emerges , always responding with , \" this is nothing ! \" by the time the film makes it to the midpoint , everything that is going to happen in terms of plot happens . the first act is quickly paced , while the second act contains most of the jokes and is the core of the film . every ten minutes or so a new problem crops up that motss and brean must deal with , and it \\' s always fascinating to see what they do and how they do it . the screenplay provides good characterization and actually deals with most of the problems head - on in realistic manners . however , it does have a tendency to avoid things and shift its focus from the election campaign and false war smokescreen to something a bit off the subject . as the third act rolls around the satirical nature becomes more concerned with the situations and less so with the big picture . what had started off as a brilliant , somewhat harmless conspiracy to fool the general public begins to seem more like something that would happen in a movie . still , the situation comedy is quite funny , especially a montage showing the entire country flinging old shoes into trees to honor sgt . willie schumann - a war hero motss and brean concocted . truly great satire manages to create for an entertaining story that makes you laugh at the time , but think about afterwards and \" wag the dog \" at least succeeds in this respect . however , in retrospect it seems like so much more could have been done , namely by extending the running time and filling in the plot holes . then again , it \\' s a valiant effort .',\n",

\" ) . the day wide - eyed , shy new student cameron james ( joseph gordon - levitt ) starts school at seattle - based padua high , he is swept away at the sight of the beautiful and popular sophomore , bianca stratford ( larisa oleynik ) . although he doesn \\' t know french , he purposefully learns some of it just so he can tutor her , but finds that her paranoid gynecologist father ( larry miller ) won \\' t allow her to date until her bitter , unconventional older sister , kat ( julia stiles ) , a senior , decides to . kat , of course , has sworn off the likes of boys , but cameron sets out to find someone that will be the perfect match for her , which is exactly what he finds in the form of the rebellious patrick verona ( heath ledger ) . complicating matters , cameron \\' s dorky friend , michael ( david krumholtz ) , decides to use a wealthy jock , joey ( andrew keegan ) , who also has his sights set on bianca , as a pawn so that he will pay patrick to get kat to go out with him , and then cameron hopes to steal bianca away from joey . as you can see , \" 10 things i hate about you \" includes a huge number of characters , some of which i haven \\' t even mentioned , such as kat \\' s shakespeare - obsessed friend , mandella ( susan may pratt ) and bianca \\' s materialistic comrade , chastity ( gabrielle union ) . at a short , but well - used running time of 98 minutes , all of the characters are perfectly handled , satisfyingly developed , and , for the most part , are not treated as caricatures ( another flaw of \" she \\' s all that , \" where the bad guys ( and gals ) ran around constantly saying , \" you \\' re vapor \" ) . since i could sympathize with the realistic depictions of the central characters , and since many of the comedic and dramatic scenes were surprisingly effective , i got completely caught up in all of the relationships and was thoroughly entertained . aside from a good screenplay , it \\' s the performances that can make or break a movie , and director junger has really hit the jackpot . aside from joseph gordon - levitt ( \" 3rd rock from the sun \" ) , who gives his strongest performance to date here , none of the actors are that well - known , but it is this aspect that brings a particular freshness to the proceedings . as the main character of kat , julia stiles ( last seen in the miniseries \" the \\' 60s \" ) is marvelous and always believable , and certainly has a bright future ahead of her . even though it is her role that is initially the most difficult and hard - edged , it was easy to identify with kat \\' s way of thinking ( she is against the silly tradition of the prom and loves reading sylvia plath ) , and i completely admired her individuality . no one , i think , could have portrayed her as perfectly as stiles does . heath ledger , as the infamous bad - boy of the town , injects much life into patrick , and has a lot of chemistry with stiles . one other actor of note is larisa oleynik who , with the help of screenwriters lutz and smith , is able to turn bianca into a person with multi - dimensions , even though she is accurately self - centered at the on - set . in one truthful scene , cameron angrily asks her if she has always been so selfish , and bianca grudgingly realizes that yes , she has . one off - beat element of the film , and a source of some hearty laughs , is the way that the school \\' s staff act , which is strikingly unformal . allison janney , as the guidance counselor ms . perky , who is writing a trashy harlequin romance novel , is comic dynamite , as is daryl \" chill \" mitchell as the english teacher , who reads shakespeare to the class in rap and , at one point , sends kat to the office because , for once , she actually thinks one of his assignments is really good . although there are a few cheap laughs that are thrown into the film near the beginning , most of it actually works , especially in the humorous and witty dialogue exchanges and quirks between the characters . in one very funny scene , chastity asks , \" i know people can be overwhelmed , and they can be underwhelmed , but can people just be . . . whelmed ?

       " ('labelling is sometimes everything . in original mad max , the opening title set the plot of the movie in near future , thus making it one of the science fiction classics , despite the future world being almost exactly like our own . walter hill wanted the same opening title for his action classic the warriors . producers weren \\' t thrilled by that idea and consequently the movie lost all of its futuristic overtones . on the other hand , producers were right on the mark ; walter hill was accused of actually promoting some disturbing trends that were quite visible in contemporary america . to make the movie even more distant from future , plot was loosely based on anabasis , historical book written by xenophon , greek mercenary soldier who had described his adventures in ancient persia 2400 years ago . instead of ancient persia , movie begins in contemporary coney island , where cleon ( dorsey wright ) , leader of the warriors , local youth gang , gets invitation to the great gathering of all youth gangs from the city . the gathering , organised by gramercy park riffs , most powerful gang in the city , is taking place in bronx . that is far away from warriors \\' home territory , but small and unarmed delegation of the warriors gets there safely thanks to the general truce . on the gathering , cyrus ( roger hill ) , charismatic leader of the riffs , announces his grand plan to unite all the gangs and take over the city . crowd is enthusiastic , but the small gang of rogues , led by psychopathic luther ( david patrick kelly ) uses the opportunity to assassinate cyrus . police simultaneously raids the gathering , and in the commotion warriors get blamed by the killing , and their leader gets killed by riffs . the remaining eight , led by cleon \\' s lieutenant swann ( michael beck ) , must now try to get to coney island , but this time unprotected by truce and instead being chased by all the gangs . upon its release , despite the controversies and even some youth riots that were allegedly inspired by it , the warriors enjoyed immense popularity and very quickly received some kind of a cult status . however , despite being one of the best movies of that year , and being directed by talented action director walter hill at the peak of his career , the movie failed to leave as strong impression to the future generations as some other cinematic achievements of that same year . the reason for that probably lies in a fact that this movie aged very quickly . if walter hill \\' s idea was to warn the public about problems of urban america , he failed miserably . the future was much worse than his vision . the youth gangs , as presented in the warriors , are far from shadowy armies , able to take over entire cities . their members seem more interested in unorthodox fashion and their little petty feuds than such prosaic , and for the public more annoying , matters like crime . in their vocabulary , word \" arms \" is reserved for small knives and blunt objects , and only few of them use heavy artillery like handguns . they even have their own , very strict and detailed laws , upheld more strictly than some governments do with their own . many people in american cities would be more than happy to see their young criminals behaving like those in the warriors . some of the critics who accused hill of actually praising youth crime had a lot arguments in their favour . despite those objections , the warriors have all the elements of a very good film . the plot is simple , and serves as good basis for numerous action scenes . the fights are brilliantly choreographed and quite realistic , although there isn \\' t much bloodshed or gore in the movie . editing is superb , events happen at quick pace , with the exception of middle , when boring moralistic exchanges between swann and his would - be - girlfriend mercy ( deborah van valkenburgh ) drag the plot from straight action to social drama territory . the soundtrack by barry de vorzon is very suggestive and recognisable . yet , the trademark of this film are the actors who showed great talent , although most of them later sunk into anonymity . best known of them is david patrick kelly , whose superb and original performance in this film later subscribed him to the roles of psychopathic villains . michael beck as cool , almost statesman - like leader of a gang , is also very good , and james remar gives good contrast as his hot - shot contender for top spot . all in all , this movie is perhaps dated , yet in its hour and half can give a lot more entertainment than most of the contemporary movies .',\n",

       " ('watching the movie , i vowed to subtract half a star from the review because the filmmakers included a saccharine syrup , cute \\' n cuddly , computer - generated monkey . if the monkey died , the movie got an extra half star . alas , the monkey showed up at the end , unharmed , to the wet sickly sound of gagging and rolling eyeballs . what that means is that lost in space actually deserved 2 stars . that \\' s pretty generous , considering the movie \\' s camp lacked any hint of tongue in cheek . when will robinson ( jack johnson ) teaches his pet robot about friendship , you are actually supposed to buy it . so why such a seemingly high rating ? there are a few reasons that made me unable to throw away the experience with the garbage . first , we saw the movie on opening night of the first day of operation of a brand new theater . the sound and screen kicked ass . nobody in the country enjoyed the movie as much as my audience did ( and i don \\' t necessarily mean that in a good way ) . also , there were more than zero scenes where i found myself rooting for the robinsons , or getting caught up in the movie \\' s tension . i even liked the computer - generated settings . i usually prefer to see models or sets , but the cg was more detailed than i \\' ve seen in a lot of movies ; it looks like someone spent a little overtime to render some of the futuristic cities . also , gary oldman is never a bad actor , even though he is typecast as a villain . william hurt isn \\' t too bad either . neither actor had a great role , but their performances were watchable . and perhaps i shouldn \\' t admit this , but something about the tone and outlook of the movie brought me back to my childhood . there is very little swearing or blood ; there is a strong moral message , saccharine though it is ; there is a bit of romance ( whose culmination after 2 hours is a \" real \" kiss -- no sex ) . it felt like one of those disney movies that i so looked forward to when i was six . those movies were probably as bad as lost in space , but at the time , they were manna from heaven . that type of moviemaking is a lost art . now for the bad news . worst and most unforgivable was the incredibly bad dialogue . it \\' s squeaky - clean , family fun , trying hard to be as hip as pulp fiction . \" you better hold on to your joystick , \" is one such line . and when a robinson is called upon to deliver a line about warp conduit thingamajigs , they inevitably stumble badly enough to embarrass even the lowliest star trek ensign . second worst , and closely related , is the screenplay . the story \\' s exposition takes place at a press conference , which allows the writers to explain what \\' s happening with the least amount of creativity , effort , or interest . once the story gets going , i do concede a momentary burst of interest once in a while , but on the whole , the situations that arise are silly and contrived . when gary oldman easily reprograms will \\' s pet robot to kill the robinsons , my friend summed it up perfectly : \" he flipped the switch to \\' evil . \\' \" then there \\' s the tone of the movie . the colorado daily said the film would have been more interesting if the central character was will robinson and not his father john robinson . then it could be an adventure movie . they \\' re mostly right , except that johnson ( will ) wasn \\' t a good enough actor to carry it off . still , that the film has the robinson patriarch as our hero shows a lack of imagination . just because a movie is tame enough for kids doesn \\' t mean that we have to bow to a \" promise keepers \" notion of who \\' s the center of a family . many quality family films have been made with a non - traditional family structure ( fly away home comes to mind ) to much better effect . and the politics of the time seem a bit conservative and regressive for a futuristic movie . in star wars , the rebels were the good guys . we were rooting for those who were fighting against the system . in lost in space , the rebels are the bad guys , a terrorist force that must be killed , crushed and silenced so that our children may live free . that ominous excuse for violence almost makes me sympathize with the terrorists . finally , a few specific details deserve criticism . the movie tells us that the setting is the year 2056 . why ? why bother saying what year this is . just tell us it \\' s the future . i bring it up because the tv series was supposed to take place in 1997 . setting a specific date only dates the movie and guarantees that it won \\' t be timeless ( not that this movie was really in the running anyway . ) . then there is a scene that shows john robinson checking one of his controls on a chair that rises about fifteen feet on a pole . this silly waste of money reminded me of bugs bunny \\' s barber chair , and only shows that the future is a time when spaceship designers haven \\' t learned a thing about ergonomics . one vaguely redeeming quality is that the end credits succeed where the rest of the film failed : it made lost in space look cool . the strong techno beat sampled the cheesiest dialogue and , out of context , made it sound hip . this is overlaid on a cool jumpy credit sequence with interesting distorted clips from the movie . but if that \\' s the best part of the movie , i can \\' t in good conscience recommend it . still , if you get stuck seeing it , as we did , you might be able to appreciate it if you keep your distance , think of liking bad movies as a child , and bring along your \" bad movie bingo \" cards .',\n",

       " (\"depending on your degree of cinematic acumen , last man standing is either a ) a prohibition - era remake of akira kurosawa ' s 1961 classic yojimbo ; b ) a prohibition - era remake of sergio leone ' s 1964 classic a fistful of dollars ; c ) a prohibition - era action drama with a completely original story - line . new line is certainly counting on the fact that there are far more potential viewers in category ( c ) than in the other two combined , much as the recent remakes of diabolique and the vanishing counted on avoiding such comparisons . the fact is that there is yet another way of looking at last man standing , which is as the first film version of the story which nods to the _real_ source material , the dashiell hammett novel _red harvest_ . it also shows that kurosawa and leone knew better what to do with that material than hammett himself . this time around , the man with no name is played by bruce willis , a fellow with a shady history of an undefined nature who rolls into the texas border town of jericho one day on his way to mexico . by all appearances , jericho is well on its way to becoming a ghost town , with the few remaining inhabitants generally belonging to one of two bootlegging operations fighting for control of liquor coming over the border . one is headed by an irishman named doyle ( david patrick kelly ) ; the other is run by chicago - connected italian mobster strozzi ( ned eisenberg ) . calling himself john smith , the man decides that there is money to be made from the conflict , and hires himself out as an enforcer to doyle ' s side . but smith ' s allegiance is as uncertain as his name , and he begins to play the two sides against each other while trying to stay one step ahead of both of them . viewers familiar with both previous incarnations of this story will find virtually nothing radically changed from a plotting standpoint , and that alone should make last man standing somewhat more respectable than other recent hollywood remakes - cum - bastardizations . there is the happily ineffectual lawman ( bruce dern ) , the unhappily detained object of one of the bosses ' affections ( karina lombard ) , the barkeep who becomes our anti - hero ' s only friend ( william sanderson ) , suspicious lieutenants ( christopher walken and michael imperioli ) to question the bosses ' trust in smith , a brutal beating , and a big fire . director walter hill gives the proceedings his usual injection of steroids , including a pair of guns for willis which have the ability to propel an assailant backward with sufficient thrust to achieve escape velocity , but at least he doesn ' t try to turn the story into a slasher film or a buddy picture . what he _does_ do is nearly as big a mistake , and that is to provide a running voice - over narration by willis which rings of the standard hard - boiled style of pulp detective fiction . yes , that narration is full of cliches , but those are are not particularly troubling . the problem is that both yojimbo and a fistful of dollars succeeded largely on the inscrutability of their lead characters . they were a mystery , to the other characters in the film and to the audience , their motives never entirely clear even after they have acted , and that quality contributed to their almost mythical status . with john smith ' s voice chattering on in the background and allowing us into his every thought , he becomes more mundane , just another tough guy trying to stay alive . it feels like a hammett novel , all right , and hill can plead faithfulness to his text for his choice , but it simply doesn ' t work . the narration allows the man with no name to take us into his confidence , and the man with no name takes _no one_ into his confidence . even if you walk into last man standing as a blank slate , i can ' t imagine it being much more than a heavily armed minor distraction . willis tones down his macho swagger as the taciturn smith , but there is still a level on which he always seems like he is counting on being tougher than everyone else rather than smarter than everyone else . christopher walken plays doyle ' s brutal henchman as a slight variation on his gallery of soft - spoken psychos , and there isn ' t another single character whom makes even the slightest impression . with no compelling antagonist for smith , there is no build - up towards the expected showdown , and when it does come , that showdown is over so quickly you wonder what all the fuss was about . cinematographer lloyd ahern ( who also did the only noteworthy work on hill ' s 1995 flop wild bill ) creates some nifty sunburned vistas , but his work is only to keep the eye distracted between the spurts of gunfire and the next bit of counter - productive narration . sometimes when someone sees a lackluster remake of a revered original , they ' ll wonder what all the talk was about . in the case of last man standing , it is those who know the originals who will wonder what all that talking was about .\",\n",

i know that the slasher film is not a particularly intelligent genre , but ben willis has got to go down as one of the most silly slashers in mainstream horror . come on , the guy looks like the gorton \\' s fisherman , and his gruff voice makes him sound like a disney pirate . though his lightning - lit appearances ellicited much - needed laughter in the theater , his appearance borders on the absurd in the horror film , and that \\' s * really * saying something . so , all that \\' s left to talk about here is jennifer love hewitt and brandy . both prance about in tightfitting , revealing outfits or in various states of undress , yet neither of them ever actually do a nude scene . hewitt , however , does do a post - shower scene in which her thin bathrobe is quite . . . titillating . this scene alone made this one - star turkey earn two stars under my rating system . otherwise , hewitt and brandy both grate on the nerves . early in the film , for instance , brandy wins the trip to the bahamas . she and hewitt jump around and scream and screech for what seems like forever . i needed extra - strength tylenol after that part . oh , and the film \\' s conclusion , talk about repetitive ! people who saw i know what you did last summer will predict i still know \\' s ending at least 5 minutes before it happens . boring ! i saw this movie with my brother at the local downtown movie theater . admission is only one dollar on wednesdays , and we often go see bad movies on these days just to ridicule them . it \\' s usually a fun thing to do along with the rest of the audience , who don \\' t seem to mind participating in a mass \" mystery science theater 3000 \" - type viewing . i still know what you did last summer , however , produced several lengthy uncomfortable silences from the audience , underscoring how bad it * really * is . if it weren \\' t for the main actresses \\' revealing wardrobes , i \\' d have had a very , very hard time sitting through this lame sequel . i can \\' t imagine trying to watch it on video ( horror films seem 10 times better in a theater because they rely heavily on audience participation ) and wouldn \\' t recommend it to people , unless they \\' re horror film fanatics or huge fans of hewitt and brandy . i read on a website somewhere that another sequel is already in the works . what a depressing thought . hewitt apparently needs to spend more time on tv figuring out how to act . rated r , this film contains lots of violence , several gory scenes , and a couple nubile , horny teenagers -- though the sex act itself is always thwarted . i \\' d say this is unsuitable for kids , but teens wouldn \\' t have a problem sitting through it , especially since they obviously compose the film \\' s target audience .',\n",

( walker \\' s \" seven \" did a much better job on that theme by refusing to compromise ) . cage tries hard to pull it off , but the script doesn \\' t give him enough to work with . phoenix walks away with the movie - he \\' s smart , charming , and funny . other cast members include \" fargo \" \\' s peter stormare camping it up as porn auteur dino velvet and \" the sopranos \" \\' s james gandolfini as a soulless porn merchant who pushes tom too far . in the last analysis , since \" 8mm \" falls short of its pretensions and its promise , its just another private eye story in the raymond chandler / ross macdonald tradition of having the detective uncover the depravity behind the glossy facade of wealth and privilege . however , unlike other predictable fare in the genre - last year \\' s \" twilight , \" for example - \" 8mm \" is especially disappointing because it could have been much more than it is .',\n",

       " (\"out of sight director steven sorderbergh baffles the hell out of us all in the limey , a cold , uninvolving , confusing new thriller . though the plot description may at first seem like it came from the pen of elmore leonard ( author of out of sight , as well as jackie brown , get shorty and pulp fiction ) , after you watch it , you realize that it ' s not nearly good enough . in an aggressively non - linear fashion , the limey ( li * mey , noun : an english gentleman ) tells the story of wilson ( terrence stamp ) , a british ex - con just released from a 9 year stint in prison for armed robbery . he has come to the us to seek vengeance for the death of his daughter jenny . he doesn ' t know much about the circumstances of her demise , all he has is a name : terry valentine . valentine was jenny ' s former boyfriend , a wealthy and corrupt record executive . he ' s played by peter fonda , in his first major role since the terrific ulee ' s gold in 1997 . seeking valentine ' s reclusive place of residence turns out to be no easy task for wilson . he finally finds the impressive abode high in the mountains and sneaks in just as valentine is having a big party . he winds up breaking his cover eventually , setting off valentine ' s head of security and valentine himself , who decides to run for it . what a mess . i have no problem when films refuse to be constricted by the linearity of time -- pulp fiction , which twisted time every which way , was a masterpiece -- but i do take exception to movies that decide to play around with it for no reason other than to confuse the viewer . the limey does exactly that . the plot is permeated with flashbacks , flash - forwards and what can only be described as random time - travel , without any evident purpose . there is no method to this movie ' s madness . it uses a fancy way to tell a story that would be better off told more conventionally and more comprehendably . the plot isn ' t particularly interesting in the first place : traditional , mildly hackneyed and not very involving . this is a sort of brooding film -- our protagonist doesn ' t speak much and the action sequences are done with an annoyingly perfunctory attitude . i felt like the director wasn ' t very interested in the proceedings himself , almost like he made this film for a paycheck . ditto for the editing , which seems to be deliberately sloppy and unpleasant . sixties icon terrence stamp manages to at least be menacing as the aging criminal . he ' s not much in the way of stature but he has a surprisingly imposing physical presence that works to his advantage here . peter fonda is an unbelievably underrated actor : he ' s shy , quiet but always effective . he ' s adept at conveying emotions through speech rather than expression : his feelings don ' t always show on his face by you can always tell what they are . this is basically a conventional thriller told in a pretentiously bizarre fashion . why soderbergh couldn ' t just parrot down and tell a story , i don ' t know , but what he does do certainly doesn ' t work . the result is a wild cornucopia of images that amount to precisely nil -- even the action scenes don ' t work . 1999 may have signified the death of the traditional act one - act two - act three storyline , but obviously some movies have not yet transcended it . shall we go back to basics ?\",\n",

       " ('in the continuation of warner brother \\' s franchise , joel schumacher has successfully killed this cash cow . what makes this film such a grand disappointment is the tremendous line up of talented people involved with the film . avika goldsman \\' s screenplay is such a cluttered mess that there is no suspense built from one scene to another . this coming on the heals of such a marvelously written project as \" the client \" is such a shock that it gives rise to thoughts that the latter film was a fluke . situations are developed and executed with no thought of reason other that to get the characters from one point to another . this is most glaringly brought to point by the appearance of alicia silverstone \\' s batgirl , who just happens to be alfred \\' s niece . the story of dr . victor freeze is told almost completely in dialogue as an afterthought . while working on a cure for a tragic decease contracted by his wife , dr . freeze is injured during a cryogenic procedure , and becomes a man who can only survive in a sub zero environment . now of course he has become a terrorist intent on turning the world into a frozen planet where only he can live . now the logic of that little sub - plot escapes me . if mr . freeze wanted to find a cure for his wife and bring her back from the brink of death , why would he want to have her live in a world with no warmth . this is indeed a cold hearted man . the development of poison ivy is no less contradictory . she wants to breed a form of plant life that can defend itself like an animal . she joins with mr . freeze in his plan to start a new ice age , destroying all animal life , therefore giving her plant creations no reason to have the defense mechanism she had been trying to breed into them . the characters have no logic . batman of course is no longer the dark knight of the earlier films . now that he has an adoptive son in burt ward / robin , bruce wayne is trying to be a father figure , constantly spouting out homilies about family and relationships , while at the same time not really having any . george clooney tries in vain to keep from rolling his eyes while reciting the dialogue given him . to say that his performance is workman - like is to be generous . his best performances are still on \" e . r . \" . bruce wayne has the most unromantic evening with his girlfriend ( played by elle macpherson ) , that it brings into question bruce \\' s latent homosexuality . there is no spark and no passion ( as there was for nicole kidman \\' s psychologist in \" batman forever \" ) between bruce and anyone other than alfred . and even that relationship is very reserved . robin comes off less charismatic that in the last film in the series . now he \\' s just a spoiled kid . in \" batman forever \" , burt ward wanted to be batman \\' s partner and friend . now , robin is suffering from ego deficiency . robin \\' s attraction for poison ivy is not believable , except for a boy around the age of 15 . his later flirtation with batgirl smacks of incest , even though they are not related in a traditional sense . chris o \\' donnell , once considered a rising star , successfully burns up on reentry with this performance . his robin needs nothing more than a good spanking . the less said about alicia silverstone \\' s performance the better . this talented young actress reads her lines with all the aplomb of a dubbing actor for a godzilla film . she was cast strictly for her commercial value and she knew it . this brings us to the villains . arnold scharzenegger walks through his part with all the concern of someone waiting for payday . the most rediculous scene is during mr . freeze \\' s imprisonment . the guards are at least a foot taller that arnold and yet fall at his hand in one of the most unbelievable fights scenes caught on film . it \\' s almost as ludicrous as seeing michael jackson as a gang member . umu thurman struts and coos her way through her part , showing a growing discomfort with her sex symbol status . her poison ivy has all the come hither sex appeal of may west in \" sextette \" ( 1978 ) . the only performances worthy of notice are pat hingle and michael gough . these two seasoned veterans carry their scenes with a dignity sorely lacking from the rest of the film . without going through the intricacies of the plot , there is one question that always comes to mind with this series ( except for the first \" batman \" ) , and that is how do these super villains manage to hire so many thugs only to abandon them at the final reel . mr . freeze is introduced with a team of hockey playing hoodlums that seem to have stepped out of an old kiss music video . every villain ( even the minor ones ) have to have a look , no one can be an individual with day glow paint on their face or some sort of elaborate costume . with this film , warner brothers has succeeded in retrograding the series back to it \\' s tv incarnation . the only thing missing from the action scenes are the superimposed titles detailing the pows ! , gwaaaa \\' s , and clang \\' s associated with the old series . you almost wonder if william dozier , producer of the tv series is collecting royalties from this film . the special effects ( by john dykstra ) and production design ( by barbara ling ) are the primary stars of this film . and it is a case of extravagance in the pursuit of nothing . every set , from ivy \\' s lair , the batcave , to freeze \\' s hideout is set with enough neon and fiberglass to keep the epa in paperwork for years to come . there is no one realistic set or set piece in the film . everything is set for maximum exposure . the special effects have that strange cartoon look that most rushed cgi effects have . there are homage thrown in by dykstra and his team to gene warren and his work on \" the time machine \" ( the growing plant scene ) but these scenes are so wroth with glaring color and art that they are almost obscured . joel schumacher has directed the film with no flair . camera angles are poorly chosen rehashing set ups from the old tv series . master shots pepper the action scenes , destroying any flow of kinetic quality they may have had . mr . schumacher is a good director . one just has to look back on the films \" the lost boys \" , \" cousins \" ( an underrated film ) and \" the client \" to know that . but \" batman and robin \" comes off as a mated made for tv movie . the film has no style of individuality . it is the cinematic equivalent to jell -

       " ('capsule : in 2176 on the planet mars police taking into custody an accused murderer face the title menace . there is a lot of fighting and not a whole lot of story otherwise . john carpenter reprises so many ideas from his previous films , especially assault on precinct 13 , that the new film comes off as his homage to himself . , 0 ( - 4 to + 4 ) . john carpenter apparently believes that action scenes in which people fight something horrible are the same as horror scenes . for a writer and director of horror films , supposedly an expert on horror , it is a very bad mistake to make . ghosts of mars is called a horror movie , but it is more just a drawn out fight between humans and a surprisingly low - powered alien menace . in addition if anybody but john carpenter had made ghosts of mars , carpenter would have grounds to sue . this film is just chock full of pieces taken from assault on precinct 13 , the thing , and prince of darkness . it is , in fact , surprising that carpenter managed to fit so many pieces of his previous work into this film in such an admittedly novel way . but that still does not make for a really good science fiction experience . ghosts of mars takes place in the year 2176 . mars has been mostly terraformed so that humans can walk on the surface without breathing gear ( which is good for the film \\' s budget ) . it is never mentioned , but the gravity on mars has been increased somehow to earth - normal , again making it easier to film . society has changed a bit by that time , but it has advanced surprisingly little . apparently the culture has changed so that women are much more in positions of control . and from carpenter \\' s view , women have really made a mess of things . society has stagnated under female control so that beyond some minor technological advances society has changed less in 175 years than we might expect it to change in ten . the basic plot of ghosts of mars has much in common with that of assault on precinct 13 except that precinct 9 ( yes , precinct 9 ) has been replaced by a somewhat tacky looking rundown martian mining colony . instead of having the criminal \" napolean \" wilson , this film has the criminal \" desolation \" williams . instead of facing hoodlums with automatic weapons the police face , well , ghosts of mars . because the ghosts are somewhat alien in nature they should behave in some alien manner , but they essentially behave as human savages , in another lapse of imagination . the story is told in flashback , flashback within flashback , and flashback within flashback within flashback . ghosts of mars takes place entirely at night and is filmed almost entirely in tones of red , yellow , and black . carpenter manages to give us a powerful opening scene , showing a mining train rushing through the martian night to the sound of music with a heavy beat . sadly what follows is not really up to the buildup . the terror he creates looks a little too much like fugitive wannabes from the rock band kiss . his idea of building suspense is having a bunch of sudden jump scenes that sucker the viewer into thinking something scary is happening and then prove to be just something boring . these are standard haunted house film shock effects that require no great talent to give the audience . somewhat newer but also unimpressive are the cgi digital decapitations in some of the fights . within a short stretch of time we have seen the release of mission to mars , red planet , and ghosts of mars . after mission to mars was panned by too many reviewers it looks better and better and better as time goes by . i rate ghosts of mars a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the - 4 to + 4 scale . following the movie i showed my wife , who liked ghosts of mars moderately more than i did , carpenter \\' s classic assault on precinct 13 . her comment is that it was seeing the same film twice .',\n",

       " (\"seen may 31 , 1999 on home video ( rented ) . one of the best things about the movies is that they can make you really start to wonder and analyze things in your own , everyday life that you might not have thought much of otherwise . with some films it might be just a secondary issue , but with ` dark city ' what we get is nearly an entire film committed to philosophizing and theorizing about human memory and how it defines who we are , which is a poignant theme made through an absolutely beautifully - constructed film with the kind of story and setting that could only happen in a movie . there ' s an old role - playing computer game called ` d ? ja v ? ' wherein the player takes on the role of a man who can ' t remember who he is , where he is and how he got there . the goal is to gather as many clues as possible to figure that out and along the way overcome a conflict . the premise to this film is not unlike that game , only this time we don ' t have control over the protagonist . we begin by meeting a seemingly ordinary man living in an extremely dark and dirty city ( actually , it ' s more than just the city , it ' s the whole reality ) that isn ' t just that neo - gothic look ( a la ` batman , ' ` blade runner , ' ) , but is so fully developed it ' s almost a different genre completely . later he will learn that his name is john murdoch ( sewell ) , but for now he has no idea what ' s going on other than the fact something is not right . the fact there ' s a dead body in the corner goes to enhance the feeling of paranoia and a mysterious , hurried call telling him to leave immediately is also very chilling . this opening scene alone goes a long way to define the setting of the film and its bizarre , horrific tone . the man doesn ' t know who he is nor where he ' s going and it ' s interesting to follow him since we the viewers have no idea either we can sympathize and identify with him . in fact , this is the way all stories begin since it ' s impossible to know the history of a character , their feelings , values , morals , etc . until after we ' ve observed them for a while . but in this case , the total feeling of amnesia is an excellent tool towards characterization , developing the mood and outlining the story . eventually , some semblance of a plot begins to unfold as it appears that john is a serial killer wanted by the police . we met inspector frank bumstead ( hurt ) , a quiet , unemotional , soft - spoken deadpan man who appears to have been on the trail of the killer for some time . two other important characters are also introduced : dr . daniel p . schreber ( sutherland ) , a neurotic psychiatrist who claims to be john ' s doctor ; and emma murdoch ( connelly ) , a jazz singer dolled up to look like a caraciture right out of the old dick tracy serials or any given leading lady of the old film - noir movies . it was schreber who contacted john for reasons that are continually revealed throughout the course of the film . he also contacts emma , which further helps the film reveal what is seemingly a complex , mysterious back story . but absolutely nothing is as it appears to be in ` dark city , ' which is what makes it so fascinating throughout its continual scenes of confusion and vertigo . everything the filmmakers want us to see has some significance - considering how intricate the detail is to every single shot , its lighting , art direction and overall production design , they don ' t seem to be able to afford any gratuities . however , that might also be what ' s keeping it from reaching its maximum potential . by continuing to follow john as he wanders around this strange place , so much unlike the real world we know , we come to realize that it ' s all a hoax . everyone in the city is the subject of an experiment being conducted by a race of aliens to understand what makes humans tick in their efforts to somehow save themselves from extinction . but , as the film ' s tagline says , ` last night , one of us went off . ' for reasons that are never clearly explained , it appears that john possesses telekinetic powers to can do pretty much whatever his mind can conceive ( a process known as ` tuning ' ) . the aliens , which look like very old bald human men with pasty skin , also possess the power en masse and use it to change the city every night at midnight . at the same time all the humans fall asleep and after the changes are made , they awake and either continue where they left off or begin a new life they have no idea they did not have until then . this premise certainly is interesting and director and co - screenwriter alex proyas is able to keep the film consistently mysterious in this regard . he does provide some explanations such as that dr . schreber is an assistant to ` the strangers ' because he somehow could synthesize memory into chemical form . the aliens mix and match the memories of the city ' s population to see who will change and who will not . in the process this creates for a good deal of deep , thought - provoking philosophies that could be applied to the real world . however , where the film errs is by not playing up the idea of memory versus the human heart as to what makes a person who he or she is . the main characters are all closely intertwined within the seemingly complex murder mystery which never actually happened , yet when they start to go through some of the expected emotions it comes off as distant , static and cold ( mediocre performances by hurt and connelly don ' t help either ) . for example , john realizes emma is not and probably never was his wife so he does not feel an emotional bond to her , yet in some scenes crucial to the film ' s plot , we are expected to believe they do have a genuine love for each other , which is also part of the film ' s climax and ending . and that ' s what proyas seems to be inferring with the film , but never quite manages to convey in its fullest sense . ironically , this is what made his first film ` the crow ' work so well , which had a similar theme of struggling to find hope and the human spirit within a nearly identical , dark twisted world . with ` dark city ' the messenger seems to be mistaken for the message . still , the film is by no means bad and is consistently entertaining and enjoyable . there ' s a lot to like here , most notably the sheer visual look and style of it all which accounts for at least half the reasons the film is able to tell the story it does . the story as a whole is one of the most original to come out of hollywood in years . ` dark city ' is what the movies are all about - the escape from the real world .\",\n",

       " ('while watching loser , it occurred to me that amy heckerling \\' s true genius as a film - maker is casting . in fast times at ridgemont high , she gave us sean penn \\' s jeff spicoli ; in look who \\' s talking , she turned bruce willis into a wise - cracking baby and provided john travolta with is first career revival ; in clueless , she found a star vehicle for the adorableness that is ( or was ) alicia silverstone . she seems to understand instinctively how to find performers the audience will like in spite of their flaws . unfortunately , she may also be starting to understand that she understands . giving appealing actors an appealing script creates likeable movies . giving appealing actors a script in which their appeal _is_ the movie makes for unexpectedly awful films like loser . naturally , heckerling makes her protagonist an all - around swell guy . paul tannek ( jason biggs ) is a small - town boy who gets a scholarship to nyu , then instantly finds himself an island of compassion and diligence in the cold - hearted big city . paul is the kind of guy who gives up his seat on the subway to an elderly woman ; his roommates adam ( zak orth ) , chris ( tom sadoski ) and noah ( jimmi simpson ) are the kind of guys who blast their music and let their waterbeds leak all over paul . paul is also the kind of guy who adores girls from afar , in this case the lovely dora diamond ( mena suvari ) . dora has problems of her own , including a shortage of funds to pay her tuition and a relationship with a professor , edward alcott ( greg kinnear ) , that \\' s more than slightly one - sided . they \\' re two conscientious kids who love animals and homeless people , so clearly they belong together , even if paul is a loser . i must confess that , for a while , i was suckered in by heckerling \\' s casting . jason biggs is an engaging performer whose unconventional looks make him even easier to embrace ; suvari is a coquette with an undercurrent of intelligence . they \\' re pleasant enough to watch , and heckerling gives us plenty of scenes establishing how nice they are and how nice their respective antagonists aren \\' t . then it gradually becomes clear that there \\' s virtually nothing to loser but scenes of that sort . in theory , loser is a romantic comedy , but there is scarcely a laugh to be found in the entire film ( notable exception : a cameo by a scene - stealing comic actor as a video store clerk ) . instead of taking any time to make the characters \\' situations funny , heckerling spends 98 minutes making her characters \\' situations pathetic . she shows none of the ear for quirky dialogue that sparked clueless , nor any of that film \\' s interest in lively plotting ( not surprisingly , since clueless \\' s plot came via jane austen \\' s emma ) . she simply turns the film into a pity party . since loser is a film composed almost entirely of establishing character , you might think that those characters would be interesting , or at least slightly complicated . instead , you have people either so perfect or so unredeemable that there \\' s no reason to watch them . paul isn \\' t just a nice guy , he \\' s flawless ; consequently , he \\' s a central character who does absolutely no growing . his roommates aren \\' t just inconsiderate , they \\' re actively evil - blackmailing professor alcott , drugging women with rohypnol and generally giving humanity a bad name . and professor alcott isn \\' t just manipulative , he turns dora into his house slave . dora \\' s unthinking devotion to alcott is the only whiff of basic human frailty to be found in loser , and even that isn \\' t explored in sufficient detail . there \\' s more ambiguity in the 30 - second snippet from alan cumming \\' s broadway performance as the emcee in cabaret then there is in the rest of loser it \\' s one thing to turn supporting characters into comic exaggerations ; it \\' s another to flatten your leads into easily digestible mush . and it would help if those comic exaggerations were somehow . . . i don \\' t know . . . comic . still , i spent much of the film holding out the ridiculous hope that heckerling would somehow salvage loser from its tedium and justify my desire to like paul and dora . that hope dissolved the moment heckerling underscored a sequence of paul in the throes of unrequited love to simon and garfunkel \\' s \" scarborough fair / canticle . \" instead of giving the sequence a knowing wink - a reference to the graduate , a hint that paul is becoming an overly - sensitive clich - heckerling plays it deadly straight . even in the scenes that scream for a light comic touch and a bit of a poke at her protagonist \\' s foibles , she finds it impossible to stray from the gospel of paul as saint . clueless \\' s cher had her self - absorption and manipulative tendencies to balance her cuteness . in loser , amy heckerling shows a leaden hand with material that demands friskiness ( her one show of wit involves naming paul \\' s dorm \" hunt \\' s hall \" after erstwhile bowery boy huntz hall ) . her gift with casting proved to be her curse . loser may be a crashing bore , but gee , aren \\' t those two kids swell ?',\n",

       " (\"-- comedy , rated pg , runs about 1 : 40 -- starring : john goodman , kathy moriarty , and a bunch of teenagers -- directed by joe dante and written by charles hass -- summary : lawrence woolsley ( john goodman ) brings his new horror film mant ! to premiere in key west during the height of the cuban missile crisis . he hopes to capitalize on the tense moment by providing an escape for the town . we see most of the events through the stories of four teenagers and how life affects them . quick and easy review : i really enjoyed matinee . the mixture of comedy and tension blended nicely . unlike many comedies this film tries , and succeeds , in getting past the stage of doing anything for a laugh . the makers of the film also cared about telling an intelligent story . the performances of all the principals are right on the mark , particularly john goodman as the schlock master . so i would definitely recommend this film to anyone looking for a light hearted , yet interesting way to spend a couple of hours . longer , more detailed review : [ beware of spoilers ] the primary reason i enjoyed this film was , that while being a comedy , the film also had an intelligent story to tell . too many comedies today subscribe to the the notion that a comedy need only make you laugh . you watch the movie , laugh a lot , leave the theatre and take nothing with you . matinee is not like that . i left the picture thinking about what i would do faced with the cuban missile crisis . i found myself wondering what would happen to the characters of the film . but most importantly , i found myself caring about what would happen to the characters . the comedy of the film centers around goodman , his character , and the film he brings to key west . i believe that goodman is one of the finest comedic actors in the business today . he is highly expressive both physically and vocally . i felt he at least deserved an oscar nomination for his work in barton fink . the other characters are often lost in a scene with him due to his commanding nature , however , while the star , goodman is actually not at the center of the film . the movie is really the story of the four teenagers , discovering who they are and what they want , against a background where at any minute it could all end . i thought the kids reaction were highly realistic . they tried to block it out , they tried to escape from the concerns of their world . unfortunately it kept creeping back in , particularly with the fear , and the chaos of the time . while the comedy centered on goodman , and the drama on the teens , there was a great deal of overlap . several aspects of the panic are shown in a humorous light . one example is a scene where people are fighting each other for the the last cans and boxes of food in a grocery store . if you think about it the threat of nuclear annihilation seems hardly to be the backdrop for a comedy , but it works here . another reason i like this film is that i like b - science fiction movies . one of my favorite films to go watch is plan 9 from outer space . ( note i did not say it was one of my favorite movies , but one of my favorite to see . ) while mant ! never got made , many films like it were , and mant ! serves mostly as dante ' s homage to the b - films he loves . so again i would like to recommend matinee to anybody looking for a good , humorous story . this isn ' t a gag film like many other comedies but an intelligent , well - thought out , film about real people with real problems told in an often hilarious way . enjoy !\",\n",

       " ('there \\' s no reason to doubt that donnie brasco is based , as its opening credits proclaim , on a true story . but if it \\' s an accurate picture of life on america \\' s mean streets , than cinematic depictions of organised crime have had a much stronger basis in reality than i would have previously thought . for from the film \\' s outset , when a group of hoods jocularly trade differing opinions on the merits of various automobiles ( not unlike a number of movie lowlifes who recently gave a madonna song a close reading ) donnie brasco resembles more than passingly a few gangster flicks once believed to be works of fiction . our eponymous hero ( johnny depp ) is not the cheap crook he first appears to be . brasco is joseph pistone , an undercover fbi agent who has the task of chumming - up to lefty ( al pacino ) , a seasoned hood who tutors pistone in the art of being a \" wiseguy \" . regrettably , pistone learns his lessons all too well . his concern for lefty , who is burdened with a heroin addicted son , exacerbates his own family troubles : his children resent his lengthy absences and his wife fears that her husband \\' s gangster persona is becoming a little too convincing . true , the focus on pistone \\' s family life does deviate from the typical gangster - flick formula , but this subplot never rises above its television drama origins . the unhappy couple trade predictable lines and engage in drawn - out domestic squabbles ? including an ill - advised marriage guidance routine ? that slow the film down unnecessarily . the biggest problem with donnie brasco , however , is that its wiseguy attitude and style lacks the flair of its many predecessors . the awkward use of an occasional disco tune momentarily reminds us its the 70 \\' s , but not with the consistent and blindingly tacky style ? i loved those fluoro coloured suits ? of scorces \\' costume drama casino . more importantly , pacino \\' s presence triggers memories of his earlier movie triumphs in which similar territory was covered far more effectively . donnie brasco \\' s take on american values , for instance , is feeble and obvious . lefty rambles out dreams of material betterment to the accompaniment of grating inspirational music . inexplicably , lefty \\' s horatio alger inspired gush is supposed to move us . it doesn \\' t any more than his family troubles do , which are dealt in the same saccharine and obvious manner as pistone \\' s . just think a minute on how these themes were explored in the godfather movies and scarface . in these pictures pacino \\' s dedication to a peculiar and bloody hyper - capitalism was twisted and confronting , while his dogged application of macho wiseguy procedure meant that his relations to friends and family was intriguingly dark ? neither were spared bloody retribution for breaching wiseguy regulations . donnie brasco \\' s tawdry little crime , therefore isn \\' t so much its repetition of familiar gangster themes , but the shameless way in which it sanitises them . ( oh and by the way , i forgot to mention that the script also sports a startling subplot : pipstone \\' s superiors are obstructive incompetents who are infuriated by his constant insubordination ? is that a \" damn you mcbain ! \" i hear from springfield way ? ) so the movie is cliched . big deal , what do you expect from a gangster - flick ? well you expect quality action sequences and bravado performances in abundance if its going to be a decent example of the genre . donnie brasco fails on both counts . the action scenes never rise above the ordinary and depp \\' s woeful performance tends to smother the good - work of his comrades . admittedly , pacino does nothing new and michael madsen ( sonny ) simply smirks his way through the picture like a slightly subdued mr . white , but both possess an unmistakable sly charm . depp usually exhibits a bit of class himself , but regrettably , being in the presence of one of his betters must have left him star - struck , for he is completely hell - bent on mimicking pacino \\' s well - earned high style . the consequences are painful to watch . its no exaggeration to say that the film \\' s credibility is seriously strained by the sight of the pistone family \\' s uncanny ability to keep a straight face in front of their breadwinner \\' s phony brooklyn accent . perhaps we should take pity on the makers of donnie brasco . maybe a scrupulous adherence to pinpoint accuracy demanded tiered dialogue and scenarios weakly reminiscent of classic gangster flicks . if this is indeed the case , surely the makers of donnie brasco could have explored the fascinating possibility that america \\' s underworld is committed to emulating , albeit in heavily attenuated form , their movie namesakes . depp could have poignantly played a simple cop who becomes a hideous parody once he is forced to mimic big - screen gangster greats . who knows what insights into the criminal psyche could have arisen ? but then again , perhaps donnie brasco isn \\' t so true after all .',\n",

       " ('steven spielberg is now considered as one of the hollywood deities , because of the rare capability to deliver both huge commercial hits , like jurassic park , and \" oscar \" - awarded critical triumphs like schindler \\' s list . however , in the 1970s spielberg built his reputation by creating works of art that could slip in both categories . one of them is close encounters of the third kind , extremely popular and influential science - fiction spectacle . unfortunately , it had a bad luck to be released in the same year as star wars . although both films have a lot in common ( ground - breaking special effects , brilliant score by john williams ) their future was different ; one became an unstoppable cult phenomenon , and another almost forgotten and stuck forever in its shadow . when spielberg began work on that project , he was already established as a bright new hollywood star due to his previous commercial hit , jaws . together with other young directors of his \" new hollywood \" generation , like kauffman , carpenter , hill and millius , he exploited the great creative freedom of 1970s , when even the mainstream producers dared to experiment . ironically , it was spielberg himself whose later commercial success would established new unwritten rules of \" blockubuster \" philosophy . but in the mid 1970s , many things were different ; spielberg was young and eager to use hollywood resources for his very personal and artistic movie . although very personal , spielberg \\' s screenplay was partly based on the book \" ufo experience \" by dr . j . allen hynek and in many ways inspired by the popular urban mythology of extraterrestrial visitors to earth that began to grow in the world after ww2 . spielberg was not only inspired by the mythology , but his movie also gave the mythology itself a huge boost , unmatched until the contemporary era of x - files and the roswell anniversary . that was partly because he made the movie very realistic using the authentic ufo - related incidents as the element of the plot . the story begins with one of such incidents - team of international scientists come to the sonorra desert in mexico to find the u . s . navy planes of who went missing decades ago during the famous flight 19 . such events coincide with the ufo incident witnessed by roy neary ( richard dreyfuss ) , power company worker from muncie , indiana , who later becomes obsessed with his experience . because of his obsession he loses his job , family and sanity , but his loss is nothing compared to the experience of jillian guiler ( melinda dillon ) , single mother whose son becomes the victim of alien abduction . in the meantime , the scientists decipher the strange signals from outer space and u . s . government , in co - operation with the french , led by lacombe ( francois truffaut ) begin with the preparation for ultra - secret project . when the news of the poison gas leak in the middle of wyoming reach neary , he finally sees some sense in all his visions and begins the perilous journey toward the centre of endangered area . there he is joined by jillian who shared the similar visions . two of them must break through military pickets and reach their destination to find whatever is there . spielberg here shows great mastery by using the very same techniques of jaws to make completely different effects . the slow , gradual yet very disciplined series of dramatic incidents - \" close encounters \" - is set in order to bring the viewer to the great revelation in the finale . but , instead of the fear and horror we had to endure during the jaws , we are now overwhelmed by the sense of boyish wonder . throughout the movie the viewer knows that something big , magnificent and wonderful is about to happen , and great magician spielberg delivers his promise in the end . the last sequence , with its , even in this age , impressive special effects by the great virtuoso douglas trumbull , would leave many mouths open . one of the great virtues of this film is its optimism . aliens , who almost always get portrayed as the monsters in science - fiction cinema , are here benevolent and harmless creatures and the first contact between them and humanity is a beginning of something wonderful . it is very ironic , when we consider that the two classic sf movies that visually inspired spielberg actually told quite different story - howard hawks \\' thing and byron haskin \\' s war of the worlds presented extraterrestrials as the threat to the mankind . spielberg \\' s humane approach and faith in the future also lies in great contrast to the pessimistic mood of its era ; the only hint of the contemporary gloom is post - watergate portrayal of government as conspiratorial towards the public . but , even such government is much more harmless compared to the murderous and chain - smoking men in black that became the stereotype thanks to x - files and its more cynical and disturbing visions . there lies the main , and probably the only flaw of this great picture - lack of conflict , and consequently , lack of drama . the movie has few excitements or even action scenes ( especially the last that may be an interesting homage to hitchcock \\' s north by northwest ) but generally , almost everyone - neary , jillian , government , aliens - are the good guys . despite such shortcomings , the actors were good and manage to bring multidimensionality to their simple roles . richard dreyfuss is very convincing as a ordinary , yet nice guy , who sinks into insanity only to rediscover himself in a grand finale . melinda dillon was , on the other hand , nominated for \" oscar \" as a struggling mother , yet she was overshadowed by teri garr as neary \\' s long - suffering wife ronnie . apart from visual wonders of this film , spielberg \\' s semi - official composer john williams again excels by his beautiful music , this time using the simple melody both as the element of a plot , and as the basis for his score . the aliens , who are the main subject of this film , were visually very convincing . too convincing , one of my acquaintances in the ufo - researching circles said . according to him , the depiction of extraterrestrials as grey - skinned little people with big eyes was so accurate , that it managed to freak out powerful government figures interested in suppressing the truth about ufos . so , they later approached spielberg and ordered him to make another movie with alien , this time designed to be anything but the real life . the result was e . t . , for many years the biggest commercial hit of all times , yet less inspirational for ufo enthusiasts . anyway , whether the viewer believes in existence of extraterrestrials or ufos , close encounters of the third kind remains the great movie , and one of the rare uplifting experiences in modern cinema .',\n",

( even watching the first movie i wondered why any real - life team would lend itself to being caricatured in this manner ) . gus challenges leonard to a match , the buzz vs . the twins . ( wanna guess who wins ? ) \" back to the minors \" is a movie that has no reason to exist . there \\' s hardly a laugh in it , the cast is weak , and the first movie left no room for even one sequel .',\n",

( editorial ) the director of this film , juzo itami , died shortly after the film was finished , and he left behind a legacy of comedy and satire that is rare , and uncompromising . we would wish that he had been able to make one about film making , of which he must have had a few stories to tell , but we will have to do with much of the japanese society , and its many errant ways . . . . not to say that these things do not happen anywhere else . . . . america is no less guilty of any of these subjects at all , should anyone have the guts to tackle it . . . we could learn something along the way , too . . . . worth seeing , specially , is a taxing woman and its follow up a taxing woman returns . the funeral is also good , although not as funny as the later films . tampopo is also very enjoyable . all four of these films are available in video , which means your best local site for foreign film may have them . . . ask for it .',\n",

' and the incessant sputtering of ` oh , sh * t ! ' this is virtually the same character he played in jerry maguire and as good as it gets . but where gooding was once an exciting actor , he now seems dull and endlessly monotonous . at least he ' s a bit more captivating than ulrich , who has all the film ' s worst dialogue , but does nothing noticeable to enliven his character . the supporting cast , which includes every personality you expect to pop up , is also wasted . to be fair , there are a few brief moments of serviceable action . and i did chuckle a few times . one example is when ulrich ( an employee at ` darlene ' s diner ' ) is at the counter when brynner walks through the door . ` you own this place ? ' the general asks . ` yeah , ' ulrich says . ` they call me darlene . ' these little tidbits of humor are ( mainly ) welcome in this weak , disappointing wreckage of an action film . as a speed clone , it could have benefited from a lot more suspense and perhaps ( god forbid ) even some decent writing . sadly , i walked away from chill factor only wondering how much fun it could have been .\",\n",

       " ('talk about beating a dead horse ! when home alone was released in 1990 , it was a breath of fresh air , and the final box office tally indicated how much audiences appreciated a genuinely - funny family film . the unexpectedly high gross guaranteed a sequel , so , two years later , we were subjected to home alone 2 , which might as well have been called clone alone for all of the originality it exhibited . for john hughes , two home alone movies weren \\' t enough ? he began recycling the same kinds of villains and situations in almost every movie he was involved with , including a pathetic box office bomb called baby \\' s day out , last year \\' s live - action 101 dalmatians , and this year \\' s flubber . now , inexplicably , hughes has exhumed not only these worn - out plot elements , but the \" home alone \" name as well . the result ? 1997 \\' s worst sequel ( edging out speed 2 and batman and robin ) , home alone 3 . by changing the characters , hughes ( who wrote and co - produced the film ) , along with his co - conspirator , director raja gosnell , has attempted to inject new life into a series that is way past the point of cardiac arrest . the new kid , alex pruitt , is played by alex d . linz ( one fine day ) , and the only thing he has going for him is terminal cuteness . he \\' s not half as interesting as macaulay culkin once was . the villains , pale copies of joe pesci and daniel stern , are even less engaging than the pair of idiots in flubber . in home alone 3 , there are four of them ( olek krupa , david thornton , lenny von dohlen , and rya kihlstedt ) , but all that means is an opportunity for twice as many pratfalls . this time , the kid isn \\' t left home alone because his parents have gone on a trip . instead , he has developed a bad case of chicken pox , so he can \\' t go to school . his dad ( kevin kilner ) is away on business and his mom ( haviland morris ) has to run errands , so , for the most part , he \\' s all by himself during the day . through a series of coincidences too irritating to relate , a top secret u . s . air force integrated circuit comes into his possession . it \\' s wanted by a gang of four international crooks who intend to break into alex \\' s home to retrieve it . the eight - year old , who is wise beyond his years , booby traps the house with all sorts of rube goldberg - type devices designed to humiliate and incapacitate the villains . the movie \\' s climax takes place during a raging snowstorm ? only none of the falling flakes looks remotely believable . previously , the most counterfeit - looking snow effects i can remember were in star trek iii . these are far worse . in fact , the production values are so shoddy that there are some scenes in the midst of this near - blizzard when a shining sun can be seen . if it \\' s a wonderful life could generate real - looking snow back in the 1940s , why can \\' t home alone 3 , which has a significantly larger budget and \\' 90s technology at its disposal ? there has been an ongoing debate regarding the appropriateness of live - action cartoon violence for young children . home alone 3 will add fuel to the fire . it \\' s one thing to see wyle e . coyote flattened by a 10 ton acme weight , but quite another to watch a running lawn mower fall on lenny von dohlen . adults and even older children will recognize that this is obviously fake and intended to be humorous , but what about five and six - year olds ? the level of violence in home alone 3 is extreme ? many of alex \\' s schemes are nasty enough to kill . but , because this is a \" family film , \" no one dies , despite being electrocuted , falling thirty feet , and getting smacked on the head by a barbell . not only is home alone 3 unnecessary , but it \\' s offensive . it \\' s an exercise in tediousness , and there isn \\' t a genuine laugh to be found from the beginning to the end ( unless , by some strange quirk of fate , you have missed every 1990s movie associated with john hughes , and thus haven \\' t seen this stuff before ) . i can \\' t imagine anyone with a reasonable attention span being more than momentarily distracted by this pointless adventure . maybe that \\' s why the only ones laughing at the screening i attended were still in their thumb - sucking years .',\n",

       " (\"blade is the movie that shows that wesley snipes really can live up to his potential as one of hollywood ' s premier leading men . blade is based on the comic book character of the same name and has that comic book kind of feel to it . it is a very stylish movie and for the most part that style works very well . although , at a few points i thought i was watching a music video as opposed to a movie . the ideas behind blade are good , as is the basic plot of the story . but at times , things seem to get a bit muddled , and the writers appear to want to do too many things at once . that really doesn ' t take away from the story too much , but it does hurt it a little bit . blade ( snipes ) is half man , half vampire . his mother was bitten by a vampire when she was pregnant with him and as a result he has many of the classic traits of a vampire . including a thirst for human blood that must be kept under control by a special serum which quenches his blood lust . blade has spent his life hunting down and killing vampires as a sort of revenge for the fact that one of their kind killed his mother . but this isn ' t as easy as it seems , because the vampires in blade ' s world are more sophisticated than the ones that you find in most films . the government and other authorities know of the existence of vampires , but they let them feast of the population at large because they are taking bribes from the vampires . where do vampires get money ? well , in blade , they run multinational companies in order to finance their vampire organizations . i personally thought that this whole secret corporate world run by vampires to be a very clever idea , and a great addition to the movie . blade runs up against the evil deacon frost ( stephen dorff ) a maverick in the vampire community . he isn ' t content to live among humans , and is convinced that the vampire race is the superior one and he means to insure its superiority . he has managed to translate the ancient vampire scrolls that tell of the method of making him an all - powerful vampire -- rendering him virtually unstoppable . it ' s up to blade to see that this doesn ' t transpire . admittedly , blade is style over substance through and through . the story is a relatively forgettable one , but it is fun none the less . the acting in blade is just about what you would expect from a movie of this type . this isn ' t a film that is going to win accolades for its performances , and the actors know this . the movie is played for fun and nobody seems to think otherwise . it ' s a popcorn movie , and no one involved has any illusions otherwise . blade ' s production values are as slick as any that you will find in your typical summer blockbuster . the combat sequences between blade and his vampire targets are incredibly well done . although , the mtv - style cuts did get on my nerves after a while during long sequences . blade is a fun movie with an interesting take on the vampire genre . this is not the movie for those of you who like your vampires in tuxedos and living in coffins in the basement of some gothic castle . what blade excels at is bringing the classic lore of the vampire into the next century with a fresh outlook on life . very cool .\",\n",

       " ('call me crazy , but i don \\' t see saving private ryan as the film of the summer . a good movie , yes , with chillingly realistic battle scenes and emotion to spare . an utterly riviting movie on par with steven spielberg \\' s best work , no . personally , if i was spielberg , i wouldn \\' t go back to the world war ii era one more time after schindler \\' s list and the indiana jones movies . i \\' m guessing steve has a thing for nazis ; i really wouldn \\' t be surprised if a velociraptor ate one of the swastika - wearing dudes in the next jurassic park movie . all lofty pretenses aside , saving private ryan is the goriest movie this side of a 1980s slasher flick . the difference is , it \\' s easy during friday the 13th to laugh off a spear sticking out of kevin bacon \\' s chest while blood spurts like crazy , but it \\' s damn hard to sit and eat reese \\' s pieces while soldiers suffer machine gun bullets to the head and have their intestines spilled out onto the battlefield . and believe me , there \\' s plenty of it . a 30 - minute sequence at the beginning of the movie has an army captain ( tom hanks ) and his soldiers landing at omaha beach to join countless other americans who are already under fire . lives are lost in seconds as the purposefully confusing and jarring scene goes on and on , and all the young men in the audience find themselves never , ever wanting to be drafted . cut to some bureaucratic defense office , where a hundred women pound out sympathy form letters to the families of the casualties . one woman happens upon an interesting detail -- three brothers in different platoons were killed in combat , and their mother is getting the telegram today . i guess it \\' s an interesting conversation piece to everyone but the mother , so the army chief ( harve presnell ) sends hanks on what is essentially a public relations mission , to find the fourth ryan brother and send him home . that way , the army saves the postage on yet another telegram to mrs . ryan . one good thing about saving private ryan is that the soldiers who are headed to rescue ryan know it \\' s a mission designed to make the army look good . they question the worth of risking eight soldiers \\' lives to save one , and hanks \\' character admits he doesn \\' t give a damn about ryan ; he \\' s just following orders . if this was a john wayne movie , things would be different . there \\' d be a phony , \" let \\' s go get that boy , gosh darn it ! \" attitude that would sugarcoat the reality of war . by doing things this way , spielberg admits the instincts of self - preservation and complacency that every normal person has . it makes saving private ryan a lot more powerful than an testosterone - driven stallone movie mission . the movie \\' s pattern is to have long battle scenes followed by quiet scenes of semi - introspective conversation among the soldiers . hanks is painted first as a nails - tough army man careful to hide his true self from the other men . it \\' s not that way for long . edward burns , the guy you get for your movie when ben affleck isn \\' t available , is the impulsive one . jeremy davies plays the translator who is seeing combat for the first time , and so on . none of the characters are fascinating or natural born heroes , but was spielberg \\' s obvious intention . i wondered when i heard saving private ryan was three hours long , how were they going to fill three hours \\' time searching for one person and still make it interesting ? there are a few false starts ; hanks finds one private ryan in ted danson \\' s company ( apparently , danson joined the army after \" ink \" was canceled . ) and breaks the bad news before learning it \\' s the wrong ryan . and of course the movie \\' s far from over when hanks does locate ryan ( matt damon , the other guy you get when affleck isn \\' t available ) . that \\' s when the movie turns into more of a conventional war flick , although body parts and limbs still fly like never before . saving private ryan is worth your time , but it \\' s definitely no schindler \\' s list . the battle scenes are intense and realistic , but some of the attempts at sincere emotion aren \\' t . the movie \\' s bookends are particularly cheesy and out of place , when an old private ryan goes to the cemetary with his family and bawls his eyes out , whining , \" tell me i \\' ve led a good life . tell me i \\' m a good man . \" spielberg was apparently following the james cameron line of thought that any three - hour movie about the past should be framed by a self - contained prologue and epilogue that takes place in the present . much more effective are subtler scenes , like the one where several of hanks \\' men are rifling thrugh a bag of dogtags from dead soldiers , and they make light of what they \\' re doing by pretending they \\' re playing poker . this while an airborne division marches by , their eyes full of that mound of dogtags . by not explicitly pointing out that it symbolizes the random poker game that life and death can be in war , the audience gets the message . and even if it \\' s not a classic , saving private ryan is definitely one of the better war movies out there .',\n",

       " ('i know there were times during this movie that i laughed pretty hard . the problem is , i can \\' t remember them as i write this review . that \\' s not a good sign . in booty call , jamie foxx is bunz , a character whom i can \\' t really describe , because i don \\' t know that much about him . i only know that he likes to shoot dice on the sidewalk , and that he doesn \\' t like relationships , just \" booty calls \" at three in the morning ( no questions , no commitment ) . bunz has a best friend named rushon ( tommy davidson ) , who seems to be bunz \\' s direct opposite : on the straight and narrow , and currently in a long - term commitment ( a whole seven weeks , wow ! ) . rushon wants to finally sleep with his girlfriend , nikki ( tamala jones ) , but for a reason which is not totally explained , it \\' s going to happen after a double date with bunz and nikki \\' s friend lysterine ( vivica a . fox ) , who have never met . to make a long story short , the two couples pair off and spend the rest of the evening having their attempts to do the deed spoiled by nikki \\' s obsession with safe sex . first she wants condoms , so bunz and rushon go out and get them . oh , no , they have to be latex , not lambskin . back to the store . now they \\' ve got to get dental dams , or there \\' ll be no foreplay . why are both couples stopped each time nikki makes a demand ? nikki phones lysterine , who lives across the hall , and tells her she \\' d better be making these demands , too . talk about coitus interruptus . booty call is a film that does not know whether it wants to be a regular comedy or one of those over - the - top comedies . the difference between the two is that in the latter , things constantly happen which are so far removed from reality . in this category , for example , you have ace ventura : private eye on the mild side , and airplane ! at the extreme . there are times during booty call where the film steps out of its shell and tries for this status , but then too often quickly retreats to the safety of convention . it is disappointing , and even worse , distracting . there are also instances where the screenplay by takashi bufford and bootsie parker ( are those real names ? ) does not live up to its potential , as jokes are left unexploited or even ruined by bad writing . for instance , there is a scene where our main characters are in a chinese restaurant . bunz goes up to an asian gangster and speaks to him in fluent cantonese , much to everyone \\' s surprise . however , when asked how he learned the language , he goes into this explanation of how he started picking up words from late - night kung - fu films , and soon gained mastery . this negated the ludicrousness of the entire scene . if , on the other hand , when asked how he learned to speak chinese , bunz simply replied with , \" kung - fu movies , \" and then moved on , the joke would have been much more effective . this is because it would have been totally unbelievable , but funny because we know it is unbelievable . by explaining the point and trying to make the ridiculous plausible , the film is not giving its viewers enough credit . the inconsistency and uncertain believability unfortunately also raise other questions . why are two such disparate people like bunz and rushon best friends ? why do rushon and nikki fix up bunz and lysterine ? if nikki is so obsessed with safe sex , why doesn \\' t she have some condoms at her own apartment ? these questions are not answered by the screenplay , but are overlooked for the sole reason of moving the plot forward . a very noticeable quality of booty call is the prevalence of unnecessary foul language . some movies use a lot of swear words , but use them under very justifiable circumstances , as when they are employed consistent with a character \\' s pattern of speech . other films , such as the recent jackie brown , use them in ways that almost parody themselves . booty call just sticks them in to get laughs , and it doesn \\' t work . they stick out like sore thumbs because there is almost no reason to use them . half of the scenes seem to occur for no reason . the chinese restaurant , a holdup at a convenience store , and a trip to the hospital seem to have nothing to do with the story , and are in there for filler . this is surprising , considering that the film is less than eighty minutes long . it \\' s too bad that the core of the film isn \\' t much better , since it is comprised of sometimes funny , but forgettable dialog . i refer you to the first paragraph of this review .',\n",

       " ('ever wonder what happened to gabe kaplan ? you remember , he was the title character in that 70 \\' s sitcom , \" welcome back kotter . \" always trying to help out the sweathogs , frequently trying to dodge mr . woodman , ever wary of his wife \\' s tuna casserole . \" so , \" you ask , \" where is he now ? \" mr . kaplan actually spends much of his time these days playing professional high - stakes poker . that \\' s right . i \\' m not sure if it \\' s his main source of income , but from what i \\' ve heard , the guy occasionally comes away with $ 20 , 000 at a time . and there you were , thinking i was going to tell you he was doing off - broadway theater . you silly goose . well , gabe kaplan isn \\' t in the movie rounders , nor is the film about the actor come gambler \\' s life . but rounders is about poker , and gabe plays poker , and i thought that was kind of a neat connection . sorry about the segue , or lack thereof . matt damon plays mike mcdermott , a law student who also has a singular talent for the game of poker . he \\' s been playing for a while , and more than being proficient , he has caught the bug . he goes to all the underground games in new york city , knows the regulars , and knows how to win . in the beginning of the film , he \\' s built up a nice thirty grand nest egg , which he takes to the speakeasy - type gaming parlor where the big boys play . mike is there to make his bid into the upper echelon by staking it all against teddy kgb ( john malkovich ) , an oreo - munching cardshark with ties to the russian mafia . mike has the potential to take a large pot and go to vegas and buy into the world series of poker , but instead he loses it all in a single hand . months later , he \\' s paying his way through law school by driving a delivery truck . when mike \\' s best friend and poker buddy worm ( edward norton ) finishes his jail term for hustling some students , he wants to pick up right were they left off , working as a team to part others with their betting cash . although mike has stopped playing cards as a promise to his girlfriend and fellow law student , jo ( gretchen mol ) , worm connives mike into playing once more , and mike , bitten again by the bug , slides down that slippery slope , risking his relationship , education , and reputation as playing poker again becomes the focus of his life . to make a film about gambling , a filmmaker will usually have to play up the glamorous side to get the audience behind the characters . this is because few moviegoers will care a whole lot about some guy in a leisure suit or terry cloth shirt sitting at a folding card table with a stogie in his mouth . rounders , however , seems to go more for the latter than the former . the card clubs mike and worm frequent aren \\' t very glamorous at all . there \\' s a basement , a lodge with elk heads on the wall , a goulash joint - these are the kinds of locales in which director john dahl sets his shots . except for one brief instance when the two players visit atlantic city , the film is bereft of the flashing lights of the casinos or the pleasant color of the green felt table . the reason rounders still captures our attention is because it is less about the game of poker than it is about the personalities which enjoy and are slaves to it . we \\' re given a nice set of interesting characters with clear motivations , and good actors to play them . matt damon is very natural as mike , who struggles between his desire to play the straight and narrow by finishing law school , and answering what may be his true calling , playing professional poker . ed norton \\' s worm is truly a worm , always looking for the angle and playing everyone for what they \\' re worth . john turturro , who amazes me with his acting range , tones it down in this film by playing joey knish , a virtual poker prodigy in his time who now plays the underground games to make rent and child support payments . he \\' s both a friend and mentor to mike , and turturro \\' s low - key performance is totally convincing , just as john malkovich \\' s heavily - accented teddy kgb is imposing as an adversarial dragon mike must slay to prove himself . martin landau is also thrown into the mix as one of mike \\' s law professors , abe petrovsky . while landau slips well into the role , his character , spitting out personal anecdotes about staying true to one \\' s self , facilitates the channeling of the storyline toward a predictable ending . perhaps the weak link in the otherwise formidable line - up of acting talent , however , is gretchen mol who just didn \\' t seem to have much presence on screen . she \\' s a genuine peach to look at , kind of a cross between actress renee zellweger and singer jewel ( and i wouldn \\' t be surprised if the three of them formed some kind of blond - haired triumvirate and attempted to take over the world ) , but her delivered lines seemed very flat , and i found myself looking for matt damon \\' s reactions instead . a good thing about rounders is that it doesn \\' t get bogged down in the character development and statement making so much that it can \\' t find time for humor . the film is peppered nicely with scenes that both make you laugh and keep the pacing going , such as a sequence where mike and worm move rapidly around new york from one game to the next , in widely different locales . one game in a cigar club had me in stitches . \" i love the sweetness of this dark maduro wrapper , \" says one of the players , clearly more interested in displaying his pretentiousness over the cigar in one hand than in the cards in his other . i was hoping mike and worm would really take these guys . with all the poker being played , rounders had the potential to be very confusing . you might think you know a lot about poker , but think again . luckily , we \\' re given a narration by damon during the more intricate moments to explain what \\' s going on . the narrations are more informative than intrusive , and apprise us of what the stakes are and why certain players want to do the things they do . it \\' s nice that as the characters develop , so does our comprehension of their world . as a film about success and survival in the realm of underground poker , rounders delivers in spades . wait ! as a film about the culture of cards , rounders is an ace . hang on ! packed with great acting and great characters , rounders is a full house . okay , i guess that \\' s enough . oh , by the way , if you ever want to get into a game with ol \\' gabe kaplan , be sure to bring a note from epstein \\' s mother .',\n",

       " ('\" through a spyglass , i could see everything . \" king louis xvi was beheaded on january 21 , 1793 , but instead of visualizing this act of regicide , legendary auteur eric rohmer \\' s the lady and the duke observes from afar . consider it a view to a kill made abstract . a proper british ( yes , british ) gentlewoman , grace elliott ( lucy russell ) , and her loyal maidservant gaze from a lofty terrace in meudon at the glistening city of paris , where raucous crowds seem tinier than ants . the maid narrates what little she sees of the execution through her telescope ( often muttering , \" i don \\' t know , \" ) as the sound of cheering patriots and revolutionaries echoes through the air . what we don \\' t see might not be able to hurt us . just close your eyes and think of england . during times of revolution , the aristocracy may feel a false sense of calm in their parlor halls , discussing tumultuous events over glasses of sherry until the walls cave in on them . adapted from elliott \\' s memoirs , journal of my life during the french revolution , rohmer \\' s latest artistic tour - de - force may seem far removed from his domestic comedies ( tales of the four seasons , etc . ) , a period film set during the most violent changes in french history . resisting the temptation for grand - scale theatrics , much of the lady and the duke is about quiet , decisive moments between members of the cultural elite as they determine how to proceed as the world implodes . grace elliott makes for an unlikely protagonist : a headstrong , snobbish blueblood , one unprepared for the machinations of history that sweep her along . a foreigner who accepts the french king as her own , grace \\' s life seems defined by fancy attire and lively political debate with her former lover , the king \\' s hot - blooded cousin , prince philipe , duke of orleans ( jean - claude dreyfus ) . the times are changing , though , and the gears inch ever closer toward violence . during the september massacres of 1792 , she is encountered by a procession of rioters brandishing the head of the duke \\' s sister - in - law on a stake . rohmer makes a harsh transition from tranquil , old fashioned , almost stagy parlor scenes to the swell of an angry mob . in doing so , he achieves what braveheart and the patriot could not : the face of death . when grace sees her friend \\' s disembodied head on a pole , rohmer \\' s attention drifts from the societal change to one woman \\' s reaction shot , laden with hot tears . grace finds herself taking in a fugitive from justice , sheltering him from the mob . through her relationship with the duke , she seeks a passport for this one activist \\' s escape . grace doesn \\' t even understand her own actions ( and the duke reacts in stunned disbelief at how she places herself in such danger ) . she endures persecution from robespierre and his gang of thuggish equalizers , ceaseless police monitoring , house searches , even a brief imprisonment for harmless international correspondence . maintaining her stiff upper lip and pampered life ( her imperious attitude to the servants never changes ) , she becomes a heroine through circumstance . the events themselves are intrusions upon her person , her home , and therefore her values . aristocracy proves a glass house , one that can barely withstand the upheaval of stones . the duke is called to vote on the king \\' s punishment , and despite his hours of deliberation with friends and advisors , talk means nothing in the face of bloody action ( or futile inaction ) . the episodic structure creates a wobbly , jarring detachment from the events of the french revolution , which serves as metaphor but also disconnects potential audience identification . lazy viewers ( and critics ) may also complain that knowledge of french history is required for enjoyment of the lady and the duke . that \\' s foolery , but brings up the valid criticism that rohmer \\' s characters occasionally become didactic . rohmer \\' s imperfect but assured push toward the future remains staunch and notable for casting a cautious eye upon the past while taking bold steps forward into an uncertain future . what may arouse interest in the lady and the duke outside of foreign film enthusiasts with literary and historical passions is rohmer \\' s use of cutting edge digital technology as a means of exploring the theme of artifice as safety net or coping mechanism . the actors were filmed against a bluescreen , then placed against painted backdrops recreating the vastness of 18th century paris . this recreation calls attention to itself in every shot , a technicolor dream of fanciful buildings and wide - open streets . it looks as phony as titanic , but unlike james cameron \\' s debacle , the lady and the duke plays with the notion of false security in those walls of stone . why ? they aren \\' t real . the very foundation rohmer \\' s characters stand upon is false , and in their groundlessness they must discover themselves , in all their insubstantial glory . screened at the 2001 new york film festival ( feature coming soon ) .',\n",

the audience is led to believe that this happened about 1 , 000 years earlier , and if that is the case then we \\' re going to get into a whole bunch of problems later ( trust me . . . keep reading ) . also , why don \\' t we get to see earth get conquered ? how the hell do you make a popcorn sci - fi flick and not deliver the goods on the one event that sets up the film ? humans now live as cavemen or slave labor , and for the film \\' s first act we focus on one particular cavemen group outside of denver , colorado . they grunt and groan and babble about monsters . so , when the psychlos conquered earth , were the only humans not captured a herd of newborn babies that crawled their way to safety in the hills ? none of these characters have any knowledge of the planet being conquered ( whenever that was ) . this is definitely not the way to start an action / sci - fi film . one of the humans wanders out into the wilderness and stumbles across what he thinks is a monster , and he begins to fight it . the \" monster \" turns out to be a dinosaur from an old miniature golf course . he turns around and sees all sorts of other characters from the golf course , with some shrubs growing over them . so , in 1 , 000 years this stupid little golf course has stood the test of time , with only a few weeds growing over it ? anyway , some of the humans are captured by the psychlos led by terl ( john travolta ) a smarmy and opportunistic alien planning on stealing a recently discovered gold deposit . the cavemen ( led by barry pepper ) are forced to do their bidding or whatever , but eventually they gain the upper hand and reclaim the planet , or something . so these cavemen are able to do what earth failed to do 1 , 000 years earlier ? and , we \\' re supposed to believe that earth was conquered in nine minutes by a group of buffoonish aliens who can \\' t even handle a few cavemen ? one of the ways the humans reclaim the planet is by taking control of abandoned air force jets and using them to fight the psychlos . so jets left unattended for 1 , 000 years are still able to fly ? please , if i leave my car unattended for two weeks i have to replace every fluid and hose under the hood . why did the psychlos leave jets around anyway ? shouldn \\' t they have destroyed military installations during their massive nine minute campaign against us ? the psychlos refer to humans as \" man animals \" but yet dogs are still \" dogs \" . why aren \\' t they \" dog animals \" ? the psychlos are after mining earth \\' s precious resources , but for 1 , 000 years are unaware of fort knox ? why do i even care at this point ? i \\' m a fan of travolta \\' s and i \\' m glad to see he \\' s back on the a - list in hollywood ( despite the fact that he occasionally puts out crowd pleasing dreck like michael and phenomenon ) . but how did he possibly think this was a good movie ? and how did he think he was giving a good performance here ? he \\' s more than capable of making a menacing villain ( see broken arrow and face / off ) but whenever his character came on screen i couldn \\' t hold back my laughter . now despite the different facial features members of this alien race seem to have , travolta just looks like travolta . all of the other aliens have weird foreheads or other pointy bones on their face , but travolta just has a goatee . also , travolta \\' s acts with a sort of phony upper - class snooty accent and constantly whines about bureaucratic nonsense back on his home world . ooooo , scary villain . as a producer he should know better and as an actor he should definitely know better . you can make a dumb but good sci - fi film ( i love independence day for example ) , but there is absolutely nothing entertaining about battlefield earth . i did everything i possibly could to stay awake during the screening . . . i cleaned my glasses , walked around the theater , made a grocery list , chose my lottery numbers for the week , replayed super bowl xxv in my head ( with commercials ) . . . and still was compelled to scrutinize the insides of my eyelids . by the time we actually reach the year 3000 , people should still be avoiding this film . folks , save your cash . . don \\' t go see it , don \\' t rent it , and don \\' t buy it . you \\' d be more entertained by taking the money you \\' d use for this movie and just throwing it into the wind , watching it sail away ( hell , send it to us here at the jacksonville film journal . . . we \\' ll entertain you plenty with that kind of money ) . unless of course you \\' re just captivated by countless slow motion shots of barry pepper running , which is just about all you \\' ll come away with from this movie . that , and a headache .

add onto that set design that makes the cabinet of doctor caligari absolutely cheerful in comparison , and you have something to give the wee ones ( and some of the mentally unstable larger folk ) to keep them up at night . some gore . don \\' t bring children to this one . don \\' t bring adults to this one , unless they \\' re fascinated by puppetry and / or hate capitalism so badly they enjoy seeing wooden puppets raped . blech . . no fun whatsoever . meier ( west germany , 1986 ) director / screenwriter : peter timm cast : rainier grenkowitz , nadja engelbrecht , alexander hauff , thomas besvater sub - titled this film takes us back and forth over the east german / west german border with meier , an east german wallpaperer whose father in the west dies and leaves him a good deal of money . his uncle ( also in the west ) sneaks meier out of the country , unknown to the east germans . meier , however , is less than thrilled -- his girlfriend , his friends and his job ( which he likes ) all exist in east germany . after a round - the - world trip ( his boss think \\' s he \\' s on leave in bulgaria ) , meier starts visiting east germany on day visas with a fake id , and uses his money and his connections to the west to buy his girlfriend presents and bring credit to his work crew \\' s work -- while everyone think \\' s he \\' s still living in east germany . of course , something goes wrong -- and the ending is very funny , but it takes the film too long to get there . the humor is spread too thin , and much of the plot is too obvious ( as is the acting ) . still , a good concept for the comedy , and the last five minutes are pretty funny . c -- $ 2 . 50 . the right hand man ( australia , 1986 ) director : di drew screenplay : helen hodgman cast : rupert everett , hugo weaving , arthur dignam , jennifer claire , catherine mcclements after a lifetime of movie - going , and about four years of attending the seattle international film festival , i \\' ve learned several rules which , while not absolute , should certainly be given deference to : 1 ) be wary of french comedies . these people like jerry lewis . 2 ) ken russell is never going to grow up , no matter how long you wait . 3 ) any film where siff associate director gary tucker refers to the lead as \" old pouty - lips \" is probably not worth watching . 4 ) when an australian film only awards credit is best cinematography , watch out ! australia has good cinematographers up the whazoo , but since weir and miller left for foreign shores , finding a good script or director seems to be a difficult ( not impossible -- witness malcolm last year ) task . well , i ignored rules 3 & 4 last night , and sat through a film that should be in the golden turkey awards . it \\' s as if the director was trying to do one of those classic romance stories that were done in the 30 \\' s about tragedy among the gentry , and falling in love with people below your station , and horses . lots and lots of horses . the film opens with a stallion mounting a mare under the direction of her ladyship , which i guess is some kind of foreshadowing , because the missus of the house wants to have her son produce an heir . unfortunately , said son , a reckless idiot who faints at the very worst times , kills his father and loses an arm during a racing accident . highlights include the amputation sequence ; the doctor \\' s daughter , who has the hots for the son , tasting his urine for a diagnosis ; their tender kissing with a window between them ( while it \\' s raining -- you \\' d think a woman studying medicine would know better ) . the photography is good , but i kept wishing for b & w -- everything seems sepia - colored anyway . actually , i wished i was watching swimming to cambodia instead , but that \\' s life . grade : z . avoid like the plague , unless you \\' re looking for inadvertent yuks .',\n",

' in the context of events to transpire , joe ' s line is prophetic , foreshadowing the internal conflict of the protagonist in the latter half of the film . does being human necessarily imply humane behavior ? through the baseness of human character exemplified in the formation of a mob , fritz lang prompts the viewer to consider whether our inclination towards impulsiveness supersedes our civility . expressing his abhorrence towards the rise of nazism in his homeland , lang takes great care in creating a sense of discomfort during the scenes of mob hysteria . in the scene prefacing the lynching , the mob achieves critical mass at the bar . deputy meyers is brought in as an exalted informant , but when he is unable to augment the mob ' s myth of joe , he is quickly renounced from his position as town gossip . we see in a shot where two bar patrons are arguing that the deputy looks around nervously at the growing monster and then carefully slips out of the bar . what is quietly horrifying is the realization by both the audience and the deputy that the crowd no longer exists within the confines of reason and has succumbed to what the barber referred to as impulse . what once was excitement to the deputy has turned into fear with the realization that he is now powerless . to the audience , the deputy ' s quiet exit concurs with their own sinking feeling of uneasiness as the mob ' s delirium crescendos . lang educes this discomfort not through movement of the camera , but rather its stillness . the shot ' s composition places the audience equidistant and directly across from the pair of arguing patrons and the deputy effectively becomes a mirror to our own apprehensions . as the intensity of the mob closes around deputy meyers , it does so around the viewer as well . the stationary camera in this shot heightens our fears because when the deputy escapes , we are deserted by our reflection and the viewer becomes the sole proprietor of sensibility amongst a swarm of irrationality . because the camera does not track the deputy ' s movement , we are left with an amplified perception of desertion and vulnerability . as the bar scene progresses , the camera pans 180 degrees to reveal the fury of the mob . this shot is unique because it is a point - of - view shot where the audience , not a character in the film is the subject . while a long , or dolly shot may objectively reveal the size of the mob , panning from the mob ' s belly distorts the audience ' s spatial reference and exaggerates the claustrophobia of the scene ; we feel we are at the epicenter of something infinitely large . we see close shots of people ' s faces , contorted by their rage . with the pivot of the pan being in the center of the mob and angry members within a short radius of the pan , lang offers the viewer a sense of what it feels like to be the subject of a lynching . in this shot the audience is at the mercy of the mob ; lang ' s camera makes us feel vulnerable and powerless as joe must have felt in the jail . in some greater sense , it must have been what lang felt when he saw his countrymen overcome with unjustifiable hatred towards their own humankind . lang ' s observations of his fellow man succumbing to mob behavior left him with an indelible image of malevolent human behavior . as joe faces his peril , trapped in his burning cell , his dog rainbow rushes to be by his side . lang makes rainbow a martyr to contrast his humanity against the recklessness of his human counterparts . using his camera to create shots that elicit disturbing images of mob mentality , lang depicts man ' s volatility and ` impulse ' towards inconceivable cruelty . reprising joe ' s line at the train station , we are induced to question why our primeval impulses so easily transcend our humanity .\",\n",

no , so why add this extra running time to the film ? the answer : it looked cool . or how about the \" atmosphere \" ? the beginning of the general \\' s daughter presents us with imagery of the deep south - thick trees , dirt roads , sultry colors over water - all backed up with bayouesque music . nice immersion in the setting , but it soon doesn \\' t matter , for when the film \\' s plot shifts over to the murder investigation , so does the entire mood . no attention is paid to the location of the story , and the music is altered to fit a very generic thriller theme . did the filmmakers start out thinking they were making a different movie ? instead of creating a cohesive atmospheric theme for the entire film , we get the distraction of one of theme followed by another , just because the director thought he should show off some of the countryside . the above examples also serve to illustrate that inconsistency is another problem with this movie . as i \\' ve already mentioned , an entire section of the film doesn \\' t jibe with the rest , and the characterization only adds to the difficulty . brenner , who comes across as a man with little respect for authority , suddenly snaps to in the presence of general campbell ( james cromwell ) and utters some of the corniest \" yes , sir \" s i \\' ve ever heard . he even delivers an emotion - charged monologue about why he will work so hard to catch the person who killed the general \\' s daughter , even though he was totally flippant about the whole thing just a couple of minutes previous . sunhill , who initially comes across as a professional investigator , utilizes a couple of blatantly illegal methods to obtain information , and even revels in her ingenuity . both characters are protagonists , but it \\' s hard to get behind them when their personalities are all over the place , and in some cases , simply unappealing . i could imagine that during filming , west would shoot a scene , then take the actors aside and tell them , \" let \\' s do it again , but this time , i want more . \" i say this because although travolta and stowe are normally very good , in this film they overact in most of their scenes . an even worse offender is clarence williams iii as the general \\' s aide , colonel fowler . i swear the guy says all of his lines from the position of attention . a far cry from his days as linc in \" the mod squad \" , i can \\' t help but think he was acting from west \\' s direction . a couple of side characters including a west point psychologist ( john beasly ) and a young female private ( ariyan a . johnson ) make their scenes nearly impossible to bear . the only two actors who seem to have escaped west \\' s influence are james woods , who provides a good performance as colonel moore , elisabeth \\' s mentor at the psychological operations unit , and timothy hutton as colonel kent of the military police . woods relishes the role of a man whose job is playing with people \\' s minds , and does so without ever taking it over the top . hutton just kind of hangs around , but at least he wasn \\' t overacting . i haven \\' t read the nelson demille novel on which this movie was based , but i \\' ll bet more than a few dollars that the story was better in book form . the movie version has got characters which come and go with little or nothing to do except fill up space , or provide bits of information which seem to neither mean anything in terms of advancing the story nor reveal any significance once the whole story is finished . every time we \\' re presented with some new aspect to the case , west gives us more of that flash by playing it up like it \\' s the most momentous discovery ever , but the information is not used by the investigators at all . instead , when conclusions are drawn , they are such tremendous leaps of faith that you wonder if successful investigations are not based on facts , but lucky guesses instead . the army should have saved time by bringing in brennan and sunhill , letting them play a game of twenty questions with the suspects , then letting them guess who the killer was . would \\' ve been over in a half hour . the film finishes with a sort of bookend , featuring the same style and southern scenery as the very beginning . literally during the closing credits , we get to see brennan get in his car and drive off , then we get to see sunhill get in her car and drive off . they both seem kind of happy . maybe they were driving away from simon west .',\n",

       " ('\" desperate measures \" was something i was excited about seeing back when it was originally scheduled to be released : summer \\' 97 . for some reason , it was delayed until hollywood \\' s traditional dumping ground : january . now that it \\' s out , i see no real reason for that delay , as it \\' s a simple yet highly entertaining film . michael keaton stars as a maniacial murderer who \\' s bone marrow can save the life of the dying son of a san francisco police detective ( garcia ) . keaton agrees to the transplant , only so he can attempt escape . he succeeds , in a plan that of course could only work in the movies . the police force is now trying to kill keaton , while garcia is working against them trying to keep keaton alive in order to save his son . the film definately has it \\' s flaws . the plot is strictly tv movie of the week fare , but the acting and direction certainly boost it far above that status . also , after keaton \\' s escape , garcia \\' s captain barks at him \" how many men have to die to save your kid \\' s life ? \" which the film treats as such an evil and insignificant remark . the thing is , it \\' s a vaild point . how many people have to be needlessly crippled , burned , and killed just to save this one child ? what \\' s the greater good here ? many lives or one life ? if movies really had guts nowadays , i would have loved to have seen this movie come down to a final choice for garcia \\' s character . place him in a situation where he knows that he has to kill keaton because keaton is about to kill someone else . alas , movies these days generally have no such ambition to pull the audience \\' s strings in ways which might make the uncomfortable . despite a few silly moments ( and one or two really stupid ones ) , the good things about \" desperate measures \" outnumber the bad . the main highlight would be keaton \\' s performance . the character could have easily been an overacting , scene chewing freak , but keaton underplays it nicely . he \\' s not as menacing as he was in \" pacific heights \" or even as menacing as he was in \" batman \" ( yes kids , batman used to be a dark character ) , but you certainly get the idea that he \\' s evil . even the final scene of the film , which normally i would just hate , seems strangely appropriate for this film . so much so that i didn \\' t mind it in the slightest . and another bonus : the film takes place in san francisco , which usually means a car chase on those hills that you \\' ve seen a billion times before . and for a moment , it looked as though it was about to happen . but it doesn \\' t , and that \\' s creative .

       " ('it \\' s an interesting premise . our reality is only real to us because it is what we perceive to be real . in truth , our entire existences are lived out in our minds as we are fed information through electronic inputs directly to our brains . what we see , what we do , everything around us is nothing more than a computer - generated construct interlinked with the minds of others through a vastly powerful artificial intelligence . our bodies , severely atrophied , are kept alive for the sole purpose of generating heat and electrical energy for a dominating order of machines which control the planet . the sci - fi realm has been waiting a little while for something new to come along . the matrix isn \\' t it - the idea of a war between man and a sentient computer network , a sham world , the ability to plug one \\' s brain into a computer , has all been gleaned from such sources as the terminator , dark city , and a few star trek episodes ( both classic and next generation ) . what is new is the ability to weave all of these various elements together and succeed in producing a film that is both entertaining as well as thought - provoking . keanu reeves plays a computer whiz nicknamed neo , who is plucked out of the artificial world ( known as the matrix ) by a group of renegade humans who are clandestinely fighting to expose the fallacy of the computer - generated existence and free humankind from the oppression of the machines . the group \\' s leader , morpheus ( laurence fishburne ) , has chosen neo because he believes neo is \" the one \" who is destined to lead the attack against the artificial intelligence . > from the beginning of the film , we are kept on our toes trying to figure things out . this , in a lesser movie would be annoying , but the matrix presents itself in an intelligent manner which makes the puzzle rather interesting and even fun . what is reality ? what is a sham ? the film turns our very perception of life on its side . more than once , we are also presented with the question of whether we would rather know the harsh truth of reality , or live a life of relative bliss , oblivious to the true nature of our surroundings . as viewers , this is intriguing enough , so imagine what it would be like for neo . and who to better play a bewildered person than keanu reeves ? reeves , whom i \\' ve never really cared for as an actor , is competent in roles which require a lot of straightforwardness , and little subtlety . he was good in speed , for example , but laughably poor in a walk in the clouds . neo is actually one of those roles which reeves slips into rather nicely , so much of my expectation was happily for naught . in a couple of places , the script even capitalizes upon his wooden nature , and this is a heavy credit to writers / directors andy and larry wachowski . i mean , since bill and ted \\' s excellent adventure , what movie could you say really \" utilized \" keanu reeves ? more interesting than reeves is fishburne , who \\' s morpheus nearly runs the gamut of emotions , and convincingly so . very surprising for a sci - fi movie . fishburne also maintains a certain demeanor about himself throughout , as if he always knows what to expect . this helps to further the aura of his character \\' s proficiency and extensive knowledge . hugo weaving as agent smith , one of the artificial intelligence \\' s anti - intruder programs , is also good playing his deadpan , no - nonsense , kick ass role , which requires him to show emotion at the appropriate time . unfortunately , when weaving speaks for more than a few sentences in a row , the nature of his character \\' s speech pattern becomes a little more laughable than impressive . carrie - anne moss plays trinity , morpheus \\' s number one assistant who becomes somewhat of a love interest for neo . although her character is somewhat inconsistent , moss nevertheless delivers an above par performance when fishburne isn \\' t in the picture . there were few expenses spared when it comes to the special effects . many methods of imagery are employed , from modeling to bluescreen to computer graphics . of special note is the use of the \" freeze and turn \" effect where the entire scene is frozen , turned , then continued from a new angle . this is accomplished by using a large number of still cameras employed in a semi - circle , with motion picture cameras placed at the two ends . the motion cameras film the action , and at the appropriate moment all the still cameras fire at once . place each still image in a film sequence and you get a nearly seamless transition from the first motion camera to the second . pretty slick . the matrix drips with style . from the clothing to the music to the action , we \\' re watching an exaggerated version of what we \\' re used to . much of it seems like the combination of two genres of the hong kong action film - there \\' s a lot of kung fu , there \\' s a lot of gunplay . when a character is letting go with an automatic weapon , much is made of the empty cartridges falling to the floor in slow motion . there \\' s also the element of the japanese action cartoon ( called anime by aficionados ) , especially in the way the sequences are filmed in sweeping pans and emphasized actions through special effects . combined , it \\' s really like no live - action film i have ever seen . the film is not without its faults . some of the scenes and ideas are \" borrowed \" a little too liberally from other films , and one component of the ending is decidedly disappointing . some of the lines are also pretty bad - in one instance , a supporting character incorrectly delivers a famous saying , and it wasn \\' t meant to be a joke . however , these shortcomings detract little from what is an overall solid action sci - fi film that for once does more than merely entertain .',\n",

( it \\' s no wonder that the film has been sitting on the racks for about a year ) this felt like a really bad tv movie of the week , with some nudity stuffed in from time to time , just to wake up the audience . have you ever switched channels and fallen upon one of those ridiculously melodramatic tv movies , one that you just couldn \\' t help but switch back to from time to time , just to make sure that it wasn \\' t part of some sick joke ? well , this movie is exactly like that , only it isn \\' t a joke , it isn \\' t on tv and you are asked to pay money to see it ! ! i say again . . . what the shite were they thinking ? okay , so where do i start ? first of all , the trailer of this film gives away the movie \\' s main plot twist , the betrayal . so for the first half hour of the film , you \\' re basically just sitting there , watching these two \" lovers \" go through the motions until the \" betrayal \" occurs . whoopee , big surprise . second of all , angelina jolie is horribly miscast in this part . why ? well , it \\' s like this : not for one second do you ever believe that she is not a nasty backstabbing woman ! i mean , it \\' s like all of those people who complained about jack nicholson being psycho from the start of the shining , well , the same goes here . every look in jolie \\' s eyes screams \" psycho \" ! then of course , you have the case of the \" patsy \" husband , a man who just can \\' t seem to figure out anything in time . i mean . . . how boring is that for the audience ? you \\' re watching this guy screw up time after time after time , and somehow , we \\' re supposed to feel sorry or care about this dude . no , thanks ! and if we don \\' t care about him , and we really don \\' t care about her ( she \\' s a beeyatch and as confused as we are about her actual motivations in the film ) , who the hell are we supposed to care about in this film ? well , i \\' ll tell you . the only thing that i was worrying about the whole way through this picture was whether or not i \\' d actually fall asleep before the end credits rolled . no suspense , no chemistry between the leads , no real love or passion , no sense of surprise , plenty of plot holes for everyone and an extra moronic ending . so why am i even giving this film a rating of three points ? well , it \\' s actually pretty simple . i liked the locations in the movie and the groovy score , but my primary reason for slipping three notches onto this bedpost is for the gratuitous shots of jolie \\' s boobies ( that \\' s two points right there ! ) and another one for antonio \\' s ass ( hairless , just for the record ) . everything else in this movie was pointless , boring and just plain stupid . try imagining a soft - porn movie . . . but without the plot ! that \\' s pretty much what you \\' ve got here . a low point in the careers of both stars . oops , i almost forgot to mention the crappy dialogue . . . god oh mighty . . . make it stop ! ! where \\' s joblo coming from ? american psycho ( 9 / 10 ) - cruel intentions ( 8 / 10 ) - eyes wide shut ( 6 / 10 ) - fatal attraction ( 8 / 10 ) - playing by heart ( 7 / 10 ) - under suspicion ( 7 / 10 ) - what lies beneath ( 8 / 10 ) - what women want ( 4 / 10 ) - whipped ( 7 / 10 )',\n",

       " ('a film that means well , but is too pushy in promoting its belabored point and too sentimental to be compelling as a drama . it \\' s jeroen krabb ? \\' s melodrama about a community of jews in antwerp in 1972 who can \\' t forget their bitter past . the heroine is an attractive , carefree , nonreligious 20 - year - old , chaja ( fraser ) , who wants to forget her jewish roots by getting involved in student demonstrations , screwing a student rebel leader , and living with her gentile friends away from her nagging mother ( s ? gebrecht ) and her self - absorbed , eccentric father ( schell ) . her parents are survivors of the holocaust concentration camps , and her home life is filled with angst . her mother is in denial about the past always busying herself by cooking soup and baking cakes and complaining about everything , while her father is more openly loving but has recently been absorbed in searching for two suitcases filled with mementos , a family album , silverware , and his old violin . he buried them in a garden during the war while fleeing the nazis , but can \\' t locate them now due to all the changes in the city . out of frustration after quitting her job as a dishwasher and facing eviction from her apartment , she reluctantly accepts a job as a nanny with an hasidic couple that an old man in her parents \\' apartment building , mr . apfelschnitt ( topol ) , tells her about . the hasidics are ultra - orthodox : they don \\' t go to the cinema or watch tv , adhere to strict dress codes , and strictly observe their religious laws . chaja is at first put off by the way they expect her to follow their rules , but soon finds the wife , mrs . kalman ( rossellini ) , to be kind and she becomes attached to one of her 5 children , a 4 - year - old named simcha ( monty ) who doesn \\' t talk . the stern mr . kalman ( krabb ? ) is not friendly to her and considers her to be a whore because of the way she dresses . to hammer home the point of how anti - semitism hasn \\' t gone away there \\' s a barrage of overdone and uninvolving scenes with a sneering concierge ( bradley ) , who keeps making nasty remarks about jews and tries to make things inconvenient for them by preventing the jewish family from using the elevator . the film is done in by its ham - fisted script as the story , adapted from carl friedman \\' s book \" the shovel and the loom , \" goes from one false note to another until it gets lost in all the goo of its sentimentality . it starts off telling chaja \\' s story of how she \\' s a lost jewess trying to find her identity , then to her nanny role as she loves a mute child stuck in an insulated environment , and then it makes it a story about the lingering effects of the bitter past that can \\' t be forgotten . the effort seemed heavy - handed , as the film kept delivering too many obvious messages that it ponderously kept delivering through the stock characters . the supporting cast consists of all wooden characters who give their roles a cartoonish flavoring : chaja \\' s parents are given no human shades , while the janitor villain was a particularly annoying role that was one - dimensional and falsely acted . the only ones who fought through the script and showed some feelings were fraser , whose effervescent face was expressive of both the trying times she was going through and the joys she felt -- but most admirably showing how she could be so mistaken as to think that she could forget her roots ; while rossellini gave a warm performance of a woman suffering in silence , but is strong in accepting her faith . topol \\' s reassuring performance as the wise man who says all the right things to fraser , acts as the true voice of the filmmaker in explaining all the sufferings with common sense . the film brazenly uses little simcha to get across its agenda of pointing out how the patriarchal world can be cruel when it can \\' t love : it starts out by showing how under chaja \\' s loving care he \\' s taken to the duck pond and soon starts jabbering away , beginning by saying \\' quack , quack \\' and then going on to ask the four questions during a passover seder . but by showing how the boy is so terrified of his strict father that he wets his pants in his presence , refuses to speak because of his stern dad , and eventually becomes the victim of a tragic accident , the film thereby exploits the boy \\' s sufferings and his story just becomes tiresome and not sincerely done . i felt i didn \\' t just see a movie , but i attended a lecture for the whole 100 minutes of this serious but unappetizing story . it was the kind of movie that you hoped would somehow end soon , as it seemed to be in the habit of rehashing its same viewpoint unnecessarily -- the message it keeps sending was already received . in the last shot where father and daughter are hopelessly digging for the lost luggage , one has the impression that no one in the film learned anything about themselves or the past . that seems strange , since i thought that was what this film was supposed to be about . unless i was mistaken and the film \\' s real aim was to make us cry over simcha .',\n",

gough & miles millar directed by tom dey rated pg - 13 for mild language , adult situations , drug use , martial art action and violence . 107 minutes . super 35mm / panavision ( 2 . 35 : 1 ) what can you say about jackie chan that hasn \\' t already been said . since the release of \\' rumble in the bronx \" back in 1996 ( the u . s . release ) , jackie has become a fairly recognizable commodity on america \\' s video shelves . having made over 80 films , jackie has finally succeeded in bringing his style of action - comedy to the west . his latest release , \" shanghai noon \" , is a joyful tribute / spoof of the classic western . and by adding jackie chan into the genre , the tag line for the film ( \" the western gets a kick in the pants \" ) rings true . jackie stars as chon wang , a lesser imperial guard in the forbidden city of china . the royal princess pei pei ( lucy liu ) is set to be married to the obnoxious son of a nobleman from another prefecture . unwilling to follow her father \\' s wishes , princess pei pei with the assistance of her english tutor , decides to escape to america . but this is all a ploy devised by exiled guard lo fong , which will lead to the princess \\' kidnapping and ransom . unable to take any legal action , the ransom demands are met and three of the forbidden city \\' s bravest guards ( played by cui ya hi , rong guang yu , and eric chen ) are ordered to transport the ransom payment to lo fong in carson city , nevada . chon wang pleads with the imperial court and is given permission to join the team , as he is looked upon as a buffoon . on a train in the u . s . jackie meets up with bandit roy o \\' bannon ( owen wilson ) . he is much less of a bandit than he is a glory hog , looking simple for the notoriety and fame that being a bandit will bring him . with his gang in tow , roy attempts to rob the train , when one of his gang murders the chinese interpreter of the royal court , who also happens to be chon wang \\' s uncle . chon wang gives chase , foiling the attempted robbery , but also leaving himself stranded in the desert . as the disgraced guard wanders through the desert , he again comes upon roy , who has been left for dead by his former gang . buried up to his neck in the desert , roy pleads with chon to dig him out . chon demands to know where carson city is . roy directs him , and chon leaves . but not before sticking two chopsticks into roy \\' s mouth and telling him to dig himself . chon soon finds himself confronted by angry crow warriors , a friendly sioux tribe , gunslingers , a horse that thinks and behaves like a dog and an indian bride ( brandon merrill ) , before once again running into roy . \" shanghai noon \" is just good fun . the chemistry between the cast is remarkable . the performances are all acceptable within the whimsical levels of the film . jackie \\' s performance is as good as anything he \\' s done before . he \\' s not called on to do much acting here , as the character is not written with any depth . but jackie \\' s natural charisma shines through , and his comic timing is so perfect , both physically and ( surprise ) verbally that once again he commands the screen whenever he is on . owen wilson , last seen in the embarrassing remake of \" the haunting \" , gives a good natured performance as roy o \\' bannon . his innocence is refreshing and fun . a bad guy that \\' s not really bad . his scenes with jackie are some of the best bits of comic dueling since martin and lewis . lucy liu as princess pei pei is given little to do in the script , but for a change does not play a nymphet or some other deviant . the character is a noble woman of status and wealth , but finds a greater cause as a result of her own imprisonment . the rest of the performances are all broadly drawn comic performances . nothing here is realistic , mind you . \" shanghai noon \" is first and foremost a light , jovial film . and the performances match that style with ease . the cinematography by dan mindel is gorgeous . using calgary , alberta as the prime location . mr . mindel is able to create a lush , romantic western feel to the film . nothing here really looks like nevada , but the locations are so beautifully shot and staged , the film can be looked upon as a loving tribute to earlier films of the genre . and as such , the script by alfred gough and miles millar plays fast and loose with history , but with reverence to past films . homage to such films as \" high noon \" ( obviously ) , \" red river \" and most notably \" butch cassidy & the sundance kid \" all bring a sense of nostalgia to the film . it is a comforting experience . at a time when the western is considered either old hat or irrelevant , here is a film that embraces those old attitudes and ( dare i say ) clich ? s and manages to make them palatable and refreshing . here is a film that is not contemptuous of the genre . this is the purest \" horse opera \" since the days of george o \\' brian or john wayne . director tom dey has crafted a loving tribute to hollywood \\' s past . in this , his first film mr . dey shows both a love of character and of craftsmanship that is refreshing to see . nothing here really stands out , or takes one \\' s attention away from the story or action . and that is as it should be , when jackie chan is your star . and what of the action and stunts . well , while not up to a level of \" drunken master 2 \" or any of jackie \\' s hong kong films , \" shanghai noon \" is miles ahead of anything jackie has done in an american film before . his timing , choreography , and creativity are still as sharp as ever . jackie even gets to recreate a few scenes from his earlier films ( obvious to those of us that have seen those films , but refreshingly fun for those unfamiliar ) . finally jackie can honestly say , that he has made an u . s . , his way and incorporating his style . to sum up , \" shanghai noon \" is a fun summer confection . not too heavy and not too light . a fun and entertaining film that the whole family can enjoy ( parents be advised there are scenes of smoking , drunkenness and peyote use ) . an enjoyable and charming film that can and will be enjoyed again and again .',\n",

time , we can be assured to see him name among the five nominees . annette bening also turns in what may be the best performance of her career . carolyn burnham is a woman who has become so insecure as to be caught up in maintaining the facade of normalcy . unable to cope with her growing disillusionment , she forces herself to maintain her demeanor , driving her further and further into desperation , adultery and possibly murder . ms . bening makes the character of carolyn so compelling as to be identifiable to almost anyone . the slow and methodical turn from happy home maker to charnel house martha stewart is too frightening to express in words . thora birch holds her own against the talents cast with her . jane burnham is both an innocent girl caught up in what is a dysfunctional family , and a rebellious child ready to abandon them at any moment . her growing distrust and isolation from her family is something that many parents should view as a warning . she is the prototypical trophy child . when carolyn praises her daughter after a performance by her cheerleading team ( \" i \\' m so proud of you , honey . you didn \\' t screw up once ! \" ) , the bitterness and resentment are palpable . thora birch is a young actress to watch . praise must also go to chris cooper who brings yet another angry father role to life with depth and resonance . colonel finn is a man in complete denial . his military upbringing masking a desire he is too repulsed to even comprehend . wes bentley as ricky finn is fine as the enigma . the boy next door who may be more foe than friend . a deceitful and calculating young man , whose voyeuristic proclivities mask a deeper and more profound understanding of life than any of the adults around him . mr . bentley \\' s performance is the one troublesome note in the film . that is simply because the character is such a grand and complete liar , that one almost faults the performance for it . director sam mendes handles all of the particulars of the cast and the settings with a sure and composed style that is neither intrusive nor subtle . scenes of carolyn walking through the rain , carry an ominous fission that calls attention to the emotions of the character . the subtle cinematography by conrad hall is wonderful , capturing the season in all of it \\' s harsh beauty ( fall has never looked so inviting , yet depressing ) . every nuance of \" american beauty \" begs it \\' s audience to think and examine . it is a film that will be discussed and debated for years to come . and well it should , as it is simply one of this years best .',\n",

       " (\"kevin smith is like a big kid . his humor is that of a sophisticated juvenile ' s . he grew up idolizing star wars and loves comic books , having also written a few . he also has a cult following , mostly composed of teenagers , college students , and smith ' s own fellow adolescent - minded grownups . smith is hilarious in person and in writing , but when he tries to be earnest and moralize , that is when he goes wrong . kevin smith is a better writer than director , and he ' ll be the first to tell you that . that might also be part of the reason why his moralizing comes across as so heavy - handed . great directors show us their theses instead of having the characters sermonize them . this was true in the overrated chasing amy , and it is true for dogma as well . that is not to say smith ' s message is a bad one . in dogma , smith tells us that problems arise when people believe beyond any doubt that their insight into god and god ' s desires is superior to anyone else ' s . basically , dogmatism is bad . changing the minds of the dogmatic is virtually impossible , and since the dogmatic believe that they have special insight , they also know what is best for you , whether you like it or not . this is not exactly a new message in movies ( see inherit the wind ) , but i have no problems with recycling old ones , particularly since dogma ' s protesters are proving smith ' s point . smith ' s own problem with delivering this message is that he beats us over the head with it like we are reading a dogma for dummies book . but this is smith ' s personality , and his simplistic views neglect such adult issues as how does one interpret the bible ( or koran , etc . ) correctly ( or if there even is a correctly ) and how one settles disputes of heretofore dogmatic concerns . the story concerns abortion clinic worker bethany ( linda fiorentino ) being chosen by voice of god , metatron ( alan rickman ) , to prevent the destruction of the universe by two fallen angels , bartleby ( ben affleck ) and angel of death , loki ( matt damon ) . along the way , forgotten thirteenth apostle , rufus ( chris rock ) , stripper muse serendipity ( salma hayek ) , and slacker duo jay and silent bob ( jason mewes and kevin smith himself ) come to bethany ' s aid . fallen muse , azrael ( jason lee ) , proves to be the behind - the - scenes manipulator for all the chicanery . the logical but convoluted plot only exists as an excuse for the jokes and to make smith ' s points , and in itself , has little dramatic momentum . among the supposedly outrageous claims made by the film is that god is a woman , jesus was black , and the bible was written by a bunch of racist , misogynistic white men . of course , kevin smith does not necessarily subscribe to these ideas himself . they are a metaphor for the fears and insecurities of the dogmatic . smith says as much in his amusing disclaimer that precedes the movie . when harvey weinstein asked smith to put it into the film before cannes , smith thought it might give validation to protesters ' claims that the film was sacrilegious , but then he rethought it and turned the disclaimer into a joke . the film ' s humor is uneven . some parts are very funny as when bethany goes for a fire extinguisher when metatron makes a burning - bush kind of entrance . but many of the film ' s jokes just bomb , as in virtually anything involving salma hayek ' s serendipity . also , some of the jokes can be seen coming from a mile away . still , smith keeps the zingers coming at a sufficiently rapid pace . among the actors , fiorentino and rickman stand out by far . fiorentino virtually by herself gives the film emotional weight . damon and affleck are fairly lackluster . rock and hayek exist in the film pretty much only as comic relief as are mews and smith . but the latter duo fare much better because jay and silent bob , who recur in all of smith ' s movies , are much more in line with smith ' s brand of humor . bud cort , george carlin , janeane garofalo , guinevere turner , and alanis morissette all make cameo appearances .\",\n",

       " ('this is an adaptation of h . g . wells \\' acclaimed novel \\' the invisible man \\' . the actors are kevin beacon and elizabeth shue . the director is paul verhoven . that , plus a quick demonstration of the amazing special effects in the trailer , should be enough to lure us into the theatre . the problem is to keep us there . i can \\' t imagine anyone who would like to see this movie a second time . working on a top secret military project , sebastian caine ( kevin beacon ) -- an eccentric genius , that calls himself \" god \" , has discovered the secret to invisibility . the first two faces are completed . now , it is time for \" the next logical step \" -- human . caine volunteers for this risky experiment . but when he is made invisible , something goes wrong . while his ex - girlfriend linda ( elisabeth shue ) desperately tries to find something to return him to normal , he learns that invisibility is more of a prison than a superpower . but that \\' s not the bad thing -- an unexpected side - effect of the drug sends him careening into paranoid megalomania . he is naturally given a couple of modest superpowers , just enough for him to survive immolation from a flame thrower and an explosion of about a quart of nitroglycerine . soon every sense of decency is forgotten . the little intelligence that was left disappears as verhoven looses control and the film turns into an alien - rip - off , where caine is walking like a half finished terminator , spooking , scaring and killing everybody . though it \\' s based on a novel called \\' the invisible man \\' , the title has been ironically changed to \\' hollow man \\' that sums up the film very nicely . this is a very silly production . laughable , actually . apparently verhoven \\' s imagination doesn \\' t stretch too far . for him the only worthwhile reason to become invisible is so you can case the girls \\' locker room undetected . it is this primitive schoolboy mentality that eventually kills the movie . being invisible , gives you the opportunity to be who you are , to do what you want without being influenced by society . in many ways it gives you an illusion of having a life without consequences . the nature of man and his place in society is what the novel is truly about . all that , the depth and true horror of the book is gone and only special effects make you remain in your seat . caine does use his power voyeuristically in hollow man . but since this is a modernization , in other words a dehumanization , he doesn \\' t stop there . he becomes a rapist . and then , of course , a murderer . you \\' ll start wondering why such actors as beacon and shue found themselves in such film in the first place . shue \\' s talent is barely seen , josh brolin is underused and the rest of the cast suffer mostly for the lack of talent . kevin beacon is the only one that performs gracefully . his face is not seen for the most part of the film , and the only way he exists is as a disembodied voice . there are times when his presence actually saves the film from being completely embarrassing . in the end the effects are the only reason to see this film in the first place . being probably the best technical achievement since \" jurassic park \" , they are absolutely amazing . we observe the layers of skin , muscle , tissue , and bone being peeled away as a body is slowly rendered invisible . we see a beating heart , inflating lungs , and veins pulsing with newly - pumped blood . there are a couple of inventive shots with smoke , fire , air and water , but are a few scenes like that worth attending a movie for ? what is truly disturbing is that with a great book , talented actors and a grand budget , this could have been so much more . pretty much like jan de bont ( \" twister \" , \" haunting \" ) , paul verhoven has never made anything extraordinary . he was responsible for several good films ( \" basic instinct \" and \" starship troopers ) \" and some incredibly bad films ( \" showgirls \" , \" total recall \" ) , but he has never made anything that was great . in a way \" hollow man \" fits perfectly in this collection . it \\' s not better or worse than verhoven \\' s average film . he proves once again that he is incapable of handling more complex issues . and so , instead of depth and chills , verhoven inserts some of his trademarks : stupid dialogue , and lot \\' s of dull action with blood and naked bodies . he even throws in some of the worst of film clich ? s - the slowly advancing fireball , the villain who comes back from the dead , etc , etc . - and tops the whole thing off with one of the most ridiculous endings of the year ( you \\' ll be screaming \" nooooo ! \" and attempt to run towards the exit in slow motion ) . and all we can ask is why ? the answer is simple . though hollywood is a movie producing machine , the business of moviemaking has to be about something more than money . it has to be about telling stories , not marketing them . it has to be about transporting us to a different place , to dazzle us with magic and cleverness . to make us care , to make us think and feel . verhoven has obviously missed that point and this film is a proof of that . it \\' s all flesh and bones , but no soul . a void where its imagination should be .',\n",

       " (\"` run lola run ' , a german import that gained a stellar reputation at the sundance film festival , is a dazzling and kinetic film that deals with the subjects of fate and chance . for a berserk and retroactive 81 minutes of non - stop movement , we follow a fiery - haired heroine named lola ( franka potente ) as she sprints to save her boyfriend from the clutches of drug dealers . lola has roughly twenty minutes to somehow retrieve 100 , 000 marks in time to save manni ( moritz bleibtreu ) from being killed by the dealer . but , in something of a pseudo - ` groundhog day ' approach , director tom tykwer gives lola three separate chances to best navigate her way toward the goal . in these trio of episodes , we gradually learn the unique effects of fate , for even if tiny changes are made in lola ' s journey , the future can be seriously altered . ` run lola run ' is an experience like ` fight club ' or ` the matrix ' , in that each film takes you through a super - charged wormhole of bending reality in surreal and exciting ways . in addition , all three movies have a visual style that separates them from the rest of the pack . ` lola ' is no exception , with stylish quick - flash camera work and cinematography that serves as scintillating eye candy from the get - go . tykwer ' s world is a landscape of mood and color , with brilliant shades of red and pink ( including lola ' s fiery hair ) used as effective symbolism throughout . with it ' s visual style and mind - blowing pace , ` run lola run ' is one of the more invigorating movies of the year . even more so when considering the fact it ' s all stuffed rather nonchalantly into an 81 - minute time period . as a heroine , potente does little more than run wildly through the streets ( as the title suggests ) , but she has a certain flair and charisma . her exemplary running form made me wonder if she is actually a track star . meanwhile , bleibtreu does an equally fantastic job of bringing the dopey but passionate manni to life . both actors perform beyond the call of duty . the dazzling fun comes from predicting what each episode holds in store for lola , and the outcome is ultimately rewarding - several twists and turns are unique and unexpected . the other characters lola runs into ( both purposely and inadvertently ) include her banker father ( herbert kraup ) and a friendly security guard ( armin rohde ) , but aside from the two leads , no one has more than a few minutes of screen time . additional stars that couldn ' t possibly be ignored are cinematographer frank griebe and editor mathilde bonnefroy , who are both responsible for the film ' s eye - catching visual elegance . ` run lola run ' is subtitled , so be prepared to meet the challenge of reading the lightning - fast dialogue - occasional sections of it are especially fast . this is only one of the minor chores involved in watching . the other is the sense that we never get to really recognize who the real people are in this hyperactive situation . most are just chess pieces in tykwer ' s elaborate game of visual presentation , and he never really makes a significant move with any . but , the average viewer is likely to be so absorbed in the action that few will realize the lack of potency in a few elements of the screenplay . a few petty gripes aside , this film is a wild , exhilarating ride that turns maniacally on its wheel of originality . most people believe foreign films are mainly boring , talky character studies . perhaps ` run lola run ' will recharge their batteries . not only does this film offer insight into some intriguing questions of fate and destiny , it also delivers a white - knuckle visual rollercoaster ride of overwhelming audacity . like how the experience must have been for the persistent title character , ` run lola run ' is exhausting .\",\n",

       " ('1992 \\' s alien3 marked not only the death ( by suicide ) of its popular protagonist , ellen ripley ( sigourney weaver ) , but , in many ways , the alien franchise itself -- box office receipts were anemic , thanks to poor audience word of mouth ; and the critics who rallied around the first two installments , 1979 \\' s alien and 1986 \\' s aliens , savaged david fincher \\' s slog of a sendoff ( myself included ) . hence , weaver , director jean - pierre jeunet , and the others behind alien resurrection faced a two - fold challenge -- not only somehow resurrect ripley , but also rescue this once - profitable series from the scrap heap . despite the odds , they have succeeded , even if the entertaining new installment does not measure up to the excellent first two . writer joss whedon devises a quick , easy , and painless answer to the dead ripley problem -- clone her , which is what shady military scientists do using some blood left behind on fiorina 161 , the prison planet of the third film . that done , the _real_ challenge presents itself -- what do with her . alien introduced ripley as smart and resourceful ; aliens simultaneously toughened her up and made her more vulnerable , exploring her maternal side ; alien3 saw her undergoing the seven stages of death . what could be next ? whedon comes up with a clever spin : since the original ripley died while impregnated with an alien queen , the blood used for the clone is also \" infected \" with alien dna . so the new ripley is , indeed , new -- a human / alien hybrid blessed with heightened instincts and strength , a psychic bond with the deadly species , and a more predatory attitude . unfortunately , that is where alien resurrection \\' s clever streak in writing stops . the alien series is known for having stronger stories than most creature features . but the story in resurrection is more of an afterthought . the movie begins with a plot involving some military types attempting to train aliens to do their bidding , but once the creatures break free , it is once again ripley and a ragtag crew ( this time a bunch of interstellar smugglers , including tough waif call , played by a game winona ryder ) trying to exterminate them . and the alien ripley scenario is ultimately not exploited to its full potential ; i would have liked deeper exploration into the quandary of becoming one of the species she has spent her entire life trying to destroy . while the settling into tried - and - true formula is a little disconcerting , the formula is tried - and - true for a reason , and jeunet tackles the proceedings with giddy abandon . the alien , after all these years , is still terrifying , and a new breed that is introduced is no less so . the violence is appropriately grisly and extreme , and the action set pieces are suspenseful and exciting , most notably an extended underwater sequence . the film is absolutely mesmerizing visually , thanks to the solid work done by production designer nigel phelps and cinematographer darius khondji . as technically adept as jeunet \\' s direction is , perhaps his ( and , for that matter , whedon \\' s ) greatest contribution is the infusion of humor into this notably downbeat and serious series . a sense of humor may seem to go against everything this horror show stands for , but the self - awareness of the excess just adds to the fun . no , alien resurrection is not the great film that ridley scott \\' s alien or the even greater film that james cameron \\' s aliens was . but after the dauntingly slow gloom and doom of fincher \\' s alien3 , jeunet \\' s resurrection is a welcome return to its roots as a wild , reckless thrill ride . that is what made the alien series so popular in the first place , and that is what will keep the series popular in any future installments .',\n",

       " ('you think that these people only exist in the movies , but trust me , they \\' re as real as life . i once talked to a guy who thought the united states government was putting satellites into orbit which could fry an individual person \\' s brain with microwaves . then i sat in a room full of people who believed that the government rigged state elections . i even listened to a man who swore that nicotine was an additive that cigarette companies put in their products for the specific goal of getting people addicted . these people had what are known as \" conspiracy theories \" - ideas about how unseen forces work to deceive and control the public . a little imagination goes a long way . in richard donner \\' s conspiracy theory , jerry fletcher ( mel gibson ) is a new york city cab driver who seems to have a conspiracy theory about everything . his latest , that nasa is trying to kill the president by causing an earthquake from the space shuttle , might sound outrageous to us , but is all in a day \\' s work for him . he combs the newspaper , looking for tidbits that leave telltale warnings about the goings - on behind the scenes , and from there jerry draws his conclusions . upstanding citizen that he is , he tries to convince alice sutton ( julia roberts ) of the justice department that the president must be warned . lucky gal , alice , who met jerry when he saved her from a couple of muggers and has had to listen to his theories during the six months since . what she doesn \\' t know is that jerry \\' s interest in her is far more than , well , professional . he goes to great lengths to follow her around and watch her in her own apartment . but when some secret government types seem to take an interest in jerry \\' s ideas and his limited - circulation \" conspiracy theory \" newsletter , he finds himself in danger and in real need of alice \\' s help . one of the problems with conspiracy theory is that it tries to pass itself off as an action - thriller when it seems to have neither a whole lot of action , nor a significant number of thrills . part of this is a result of the film \\' s slow pace . it takes forever to set up the relationship between jerry and alice , and even once that is over with , the rest of the film seems to be a lot of boredom that every once in a while stops to take a break for excitement . at over two hours , this film could have been significantly condensed and had it \\' s running time shortened by twenty minutes to half an hour , but even then , the action scenes would not be able to save the film . instead of truly exciting and engaging set pieces , we \\' re treated to a few of the generic scenes with the requisite \" black elements \" : black helicopter , men in black action suits and body armor , black vehicles - you know the drill . they come on down with all kinds of neat gadgets and weapons , but for some reason a guy with just a bunch of theories and some chick with no training somehow manage to elude them every time . big deal , we \\' ve seen it all before . watching the film , i wished donner had at least tried to use a little imagination , but i was out of luck . now , when i say it took forever to set up the \" relationship \" between jerry and alice , i completely mean what one person is relative to the other , and not romantic involvement . oh , donner and screenwriter brian helgeland would like you to believe that by the end of the movie , the two main characters will end up falling hopelessly in love with each other , but there seems to be no evidence of that ever occurring . you see , there were more sparks between gibson and danny glover in the lethal weapon movies ( also directed by donner ) than between gibson and roberts in conspiracy theory . the two just don \\' t click , and when you throw in a number of happenings that would cause alice to reject jerry altogether ( like finding out he \\' s been stalking her ) , the subsequent attraction is absolutely forced . the script in general also seems forced , like someone sat helgeland down and forced him to write it , then took it and forced it upon us . dialog is undistinguished and rather unmemorable , to the point that i almost stopped listening . even gibson \\' s usual gift for ad lib couldn \\' t punch up the film sufficiently to raise my interest , although one of jerry \\' s theories about oliver stone was mildly amusing . unfortunately , much of what \\' s discussed in the film is not inherently important to what \\' s going on , but instead filler that starts out with potential , but ends up just being extraneous because it \\' s never followed through . for example , jerry professes that a man found drowned in his swimming pool was actually murdered by the government in a new york subway station . he even goes so far as to explain that the station was flooded at the time due to a water main break ( hence the water in a subway station ) , and that the coroner should check the man \\' s lungs for chlorine . this is convincing enough to alice that she seems to believe him . you know what happens then ? nothing , zip , nada . no follow - up whatsoever , so what \\' s the significance ? okay , here \\' s another one . a couple of well known ( real life ) assassins were found to have possessed copies of the j . d . salinger novel \" the catcher in the rye \" . jerry also has a bunch of copies . whenever he goes into a bookstore , he has to buy one . leaving out the question of whether or not this makes jerry an assassin , we \\' re never given a reason to believe why this would make him an assassin . not when we find out about his salinger collection , not when he goes to the bookstore , not later on when we get the answer to our first question . the point becomes totally extraneous . oh , did i mention that patrick stewart is in this film ? yeah , he plays this government psychiatrist named dr . jonas who may or may not be a bad guy . that \\' s about it . for all the presence this usually marvelous actor has , he \\' s nearly forgettable in conspiracy theory . you can just lump him in with the supporting players , with the exception of cylk cozart who plays agent lowry of the fbi . this guy was really likable , and i wish he and his character had gotten more screen time . okay , here \\' s my theory . this really started out as a great film , but some of its jokes were actually true ! the government came in and forced donner to make edits for the sake of national security , and this was what was left over .',\n",

       " (\"the saint was actually a little better than i expected it to be , in some ways . in this theatrical remake of the television series the saint , and its series sequel the return of the saint , val kilmer plays simon templar , an elusive thief who makes a living by stealing things from others for others . this movie closely resembles a james bond flick . it has the classic bond symbols : a man who can do just about anything and get away with it , a woman whom the man persues , a villain out to achieve something for himself who kills anyone to reach this goal . kilmer actually provides a rather good role in this movie , although at times you are left to ponder how he actually gets out of the many tight situations . the movie begins in his childhood in a strict school run by catholic priests . as a young boy , kilmer ' s character enjoyed magic and would often journey away from his schoolwork . that is until his school teacher finds him reading a book and demands that the young boy proclaim his name , that of a catholic saint . he refuses to do so and instead announces who he wishes to be . this leads to a devestating mistake , which is something that will stay in his mind throughout his life . kilmer ' s first mission that we are shown is to steal a microchip from ivan tretiak , played by rade serbedzija . during a press conference , he must make his way into a heavily guarded vault area , avoiding guards , cameras , and many other potential obstacles . once his mission is completed and he is safely home , the fee is paid . when he logs into his bank account and finds that he is only a few million dollars short of $ 50 million , he decides to carry out only one more mission , then retire . dr . emma russell , portrayed by elisabeth shue , has discovered a way to produce energy by way of cold fusion . this new advancement would change the world and save thousands of lives in the areas of russia , where millions are without heat and are freezing to death . the only problem is , tretiak would like to have this for himself and use it to gain power amongst the people . this presents the option for kilmer to achieve his goal . tretiak hires him to steal the equations , small pieces of paper , from shue . one of the enjoyable features in the film is the disguises that kilmer dawns to complete his missions . they are very convincing , not only to the characters in the movie , but to us . kilmer utilizes one such disguise to lure shue ' s character into getting to know him even more , which would provide him a means of stealing the energy formula . when the two meet , and end up having a sensual experience , kilmer ' s character is seemingly falling in love with emma russell , as she is falling in love with kilmer ' s alter - ego , a traveling artist . yet , he must reach his goal of $ 50 million , which requires him to steal the energy formula , putting his feelings aside . shue ' s character is eventually able to track down simon templar by putting the pieces ( the names of the catholic saints ) together , something no one else is able to do . when she finds him , they are left to team up and reclaim the energy formulas from tretiak . the saint is very action - packed , with few slow points . the sound was very well done and added to the many intense moments . along the course of the movie , there are even a few , although brief moments of comedy . these moments are almost always thanks to kilmer ' s extraneous , very convincing disguises and personalities . all in all , a rather enjoyable movie with nearly non - stop action .\",\n",

       " ('losing a job is not an all too uncommon thing . reacting to such a personal setback by taking a group of small children hostage is a bit more rare . while we all might feel the desire to blow someone \\' s head off with a shotgun when they don \\' t seem to grasp our point of view , actually threatening them with one is usually something we avoid . this isn \\' t the case with sam baily - john travolta \\' s slightly askew average - joe persona in mad city . \" i don \\' t think people listen to guys like me , \" sam laments during an exclusive interview from behind the walls of a museum . just a few days ago , sam was a guard at this same museum , but when cutbacks led to the elimination of his security position , sam \\' s apprehension resulted in a brash decision . in an effort to get his ex - boss , museum director mrs . banks ( blythe danner ) , to \" just listen \" , he barges into the museum one day equipped with a fully loaded shotgun , taking the uncooperative banks and a group of school children hostage . sam \\' s overall concern is valid enough - if he loses his job , his paycheck , his benefits , etc . , his wife and two children won \\' t be provided for . he \\' s not a lunatic or a hot - tempered madman , he \\' s somewhat like a child - panicky , compulsive , and running on emotion - and his naive intentions aren \\' t helped any by the fact that banks wasn \\' t overly compassionate with the let go . overall , he \\' s just like you and me - except that he has the capacity to view the line we \\' d deem \" far enough \" as the starting mark of some crazy race . meanwhile , television reporter max brackett ( dustin hoffman ) is also on the scene . covering a \" fluff \" story for the evening news concerning the museum cutbacks , max suddenly finds himself in the middle of the biggest - breaking news story he ever could \\' ve hoped for . having been demoted from network newsman to smalltime affiliate reporting , max is anxious to turn this into his , and only his , story . max immediately bonds with sam . max even coaches sam thru hostage negotiations and writes scripts for him to use with the police over the phone . at first , max \\' s intentions don \\' t stretch beyond high ratings and a good boost to the ole pride factor , but as he gets to know sam more personally , he begins to sympathize and even become somewhat of an advocate for him . the media , however , is creating a frenzy that leaves the fickle public shifting gears as often as a diesel truck moving downhill . the accidental shooting of ex - co - worker cliff ( bill nunn ) , a black security guard , becomes one of the main factors in the controversy over sam \\' s honest ambitions . also involved in this film are robert prosky as lou potts , head of the news department of the station max falls directly under , and alan alda as the nationally famed reporter kevin hollander , who uses his network power to try and outshine max . alda and prosky both turn in fine performances that fit like gloves on their acting abilities . then there is mia kirshner , who plays the young tv station intern laurie . she falls under max \\' s wings only to become a student taught too well in the way of sensationalistic reporting . kirshner \\' s credits are relatively small for now , including roles in films like exotica and the forgettable sequel to the crow . still , kirshner \\' s character transformation shows that she has shining ability to play both good girl and kinda - bitchy - in - a - reserved - way roles . i wouldn \\' t mind seeing her in some more prevalent parts , where perhaps her talent will be able to blossom more fully onscreen . while the viewpoint of the media as a greedy , self - righteous monster has indeed been tackled before , mad city provides a solid two hours of enjoyability . hoffman and travolta are both excellent actors , and seeing them together is a real treat . they both do a great job at smoothly and naturally becoming their characters , and they provide enough chemistry for us to genuinely care for both . there is quite a bit of humor in this film , and without it , it could \\' ve fallen into a drab , cliched social statement more likely to garner sleep from the audience than applause . this isn \\' t a flick that will grip at both your funny bone and your heart , but it will lightly touch both , making for a recommendable movie . if for nothing more than the opportunity to watch both hoffman and travolta at the same time , i urge you to check this one out .',\n",

( the audience will easily identify with allen \\' s sentiments . ) with the exception of a single original joke involving mirror - imaged subtitles , the movie engenders little genuine laughter . the stale humor is so embarrassingly bad that you will find yourself laughing sporadically at the picture rather than with it . the plot for the movie involves two starving actors , maurice ( oliver platt ) and arthur ( stanley tucci ) , who accidentally end up on a cruise ship . in order to escape an angry shakespearean actor ( alfred molina ) , who is chasing them , they dress up as ship \\' s stewards . the over - the - top script has the subtlety of a sledgehammer . when the leads hide from their pursuers , arthur covers maurice \\' s mouth as he suffers an unending sneeze . at other times , we have the typical zany comedy routine where everyone chases everyone else , while darting in and out of staterooms . with the film \\' s chapters introduced like placards at a vaudeville stage , it is clear the movie wants to be taken as farce . the press notes describes how everyone that came on the set remarked at what a good time all of the actors were having . too bad they weren \\' t more concerned with the audience \\' s potential enjoyment . the jokes , frequently framed in silence , fall like stones with such intensity that one can almost hear them hitting the ground . one wonders if anyone ever viewed the film \\' s dailies . surely , if they had , they would have realized what leaden results they were producing . it is tricky having good actors play bad ones , but , if they couldn \\' t pull it off , they should have just given up . \" the show is over for this fella , \" steve buscemi \\' s character says towards the end . the mystery is why they didn \\' t all give up in the beginning . there must have been a better script somewhere for such a wonderful cast . the impostors runs 1 : 42 . it is rated r for a little profanity and would be fine for kids around 12 and up .',\n",

       " ('\" america \\' s sweethearts \" has an intriguing premise and a great cast , but it isn \\' t nearly as edgy or funny as it should be . almost all the problems with the project can be traced back to co - script writer billy crystal , who shows the same lack of discipline with the screenplay that he typically displays while co - hosting \" comic relief \" charity shows with robin williams and whoopi goldberg ( two other paragons of self - indulgence ) . crystal ignores a simple , but crucial , rule : for a screwball comedy to work , the characters must be placed into a rigid social setting , because only in that context will their unorthodox antics be humorous . \" america \\' s sweethearts \" takes place at a press junket , where decorum must be maintained in front of the reporters . it \\' s a promising set - up , but the screenplay quickly blows off the rules , thus dissipating the tension of the situation . by the end of the film , all the lead performers participate in a huge fight with a room full of journalists looking on , but their outbursts are only mildly amusing because the structure has been destroyed . john cusack and catherine zeta - jones play eddie thomas and gwen harrison , a beloved acting duo whose marriage hit the skids when gwen began seeing hector ( hank azaria ) , a spanish actor with an ego almost as pronounced as his lisp . of the last nine films eddie and gwen made together , six crossed the $ 100 million mark , but the prospects for their final effort , a space opus titled \" time over time , \" are far from rosy . while eddie has spent many months in a new age rest clinic fretting over the breakup , gwen \\' s solo films have tanked . to make matter worse , the director of the movie ( christopher walken ) , a \" visionary \" who purchased the unabomber \\' s cabin and had it moved to his backyard , is withholding the film from the studio , insisting that the first screening be held at the junket . desperate to win over the press , the studio elects to hire lee ( billy crystal ) , a recently fired publicist , to salvage the situation . lee hopes to turn lemons into lemonade by convincing eddie and gwen to pretend to be on the road to reconciliation . he enlists the help of kiki ( julia roberts ) , gwen \\' s sister , personal assistant and whipping girl . what lee doesn \\' t know is that kiki is in love with eddie , a fact that could temper her effectiveness . press junkets are a haven for control freaks . studios fly journalists in from around the world and put them up in a plush hotel , with food and drink always at hand . generally , on the evening of their arrival , writers are bussed to see the featured film , then ferreted straight back to the hotel . the next day , writers go to the studio suites and assemble in groups of five or six for roundtable interviews . every 30 minutes or so , a producer , director , writer or actor is brought into the room for a few minutes of questions , with a publicist hovering in the corner to keep an eye on things . the atmosphere is one of cordial oppression ? writers are free to ask what they want , but understand that if the studio dislikes a question , they may not be invited to future junkets . representatives from tv stations face even more restrictions . they get roughly five minutes to interview each member of the cast and crew , with the studio filming the exchanges . the \" reporters \" are notorious for tossing softball questions as they suck up to the stars , but to play it safe , the studios stand ready to erase the tapes if anything unpleasant occurs . placing two spoiled actors in a setting where image is everything is inspired , but the screenplay undermines the conceit . the junket is moved from the handsome , but highly confining , four seasons hotel to a plush resort near las vegas . for most of the film , the movie stars run around the sprawling grounds , completely safe from the eyes of the press . when they do deal with journalists , the \" it is imperative that you be on your best behavior in front of the reporters \" premise is de - clawed . gwen and eddie insult each other while the tv cameras roll , they scream at each other in a restaurant filled with the media and , at the screening of the movie , everyone connected with the film goes nuts , all without any repercussions . lee certainly isn \\' t bothered by any of the infantile outbursts ; in fact , he makes arrangements for footage of even more inappropriate behavior to be delivered to the tabloids . is the studio angry about his handling of the combative actors ? hell no ? they feel lee is a genius for garnering so much publicity for the movie . all of which underscores how billy crystal and co - writer peter tolan screwed up their own premise : the comedy in \" america \\' s sweethearts \" is based on barely - in - control people trying to contain themselves in the presence of reporters , except that it doesn \\' t matter because any publicity is good publicity . and thus the very set - up for the film implodes , leaving smoke and dust in place of laughter . so what about the cast ? julia roberts , at her best playing the underdog , is utterly charming here , although i could have lived without flashbacks that exist solely as an excuse to show her in a fat suit ( and not a very convincing one , by the way ) . catherine zeta - jones makes a believable brat and john cusack fleshes out his obsessed character enough to make him vaguely sympathetic . by casting himself as the publicist , billy crystal allows himself to do roughly the same thing he does on \" comic relief \" - stay on the sidelines of the action while tossing off cornball jokes and snarky remarks . in supporting roles , hank azaria wears out his welcome fast with broad gestures and a spanish accent that speedy gonzales would have deemed \" too broad . \" seth green is amusing as a toadie , stanley tucci is very good as a ruthless studio head and christopher walken plays the eccentric director with suitable flair , though he has little to work with . come to think of it , \" little to work with \" is the operative phrase for this movie . as a hollywood satire , \" america \\' s sweethearts \" is toothless . as a romance , it is at best a minor pleasure . such a good cast , such a waste of their efforts . had it not been taken long ago , a better title for the film would have been \" much ado about nothing . \"',\n",

( and it took her no time at all to get a good - fitting , functional prosthesis . ) lack of attention to detail certainly adds up in a film . this film doesn \\' t even add up the large details . there is little or no consistency in the story - line . not much makes sense . the direction lacks cohesion , surprising from a director whose previous credits are impeccable . the moods shift , the styles shift , and no one can seem to decide if it is a serious film or satire of one . so while it certainly isn \\' t reservoir dogs , it certainly isn \\' t diva . there \\' s plenty more to tear apart in this film . my advice to someone who hasn \\' t seen it to to wait until it comes on video . there are some quotable lines that would provide a campy evening if not taken seriously . it \\' s not a boring film , just not a good one . or an intelligent one .',\n",

       " ('( warning to those who have not seen seven : this review contains some spoiler information . ) seven is a powerful , fully - realized film on the level of the silence of the lambs . it is a disturbing film that accomplishes its biggest of goals -- it occupies the viewers mind long after the closing credits have rolled . while this film is not for the squeamish , there is no denying that seven demands attention , for it is a film that transcends its genre in both style and substance . for starters , classifying seven as a \" thriller \" would not be an altogether complete classification of this film . while i was genuinely thrilled throughout , i would rather call seven an \" intense drama , \" because that is what it delivers -- meaningful scenes with a relentlessness that does not readily let up . part of director david finchers accomplishment is in style . he seems to have a knack for knowing exactly how the average person fears something as \" simple \" as a corpse . and visually , fincher shows us the remains of murder victims in all - too - realistic and graphic terms ( courtesy of rob bottin \\' s always - grisly special effects ) . throw in the appropriate but not - to - be - underestimated effects of lighting and a foreboding score and the result is a technical masterpiece of the murder scene . these scenes alone are quite impressive ; as fascinating as they are harrowing . yet , seven is more than just a technical accomplishment . in addition to style , fincher supplies substance . seven has compelling characters that it wants us to know and understand , and fincher ties them all together in a completely pessimistic view of society . detective william somerset ( morgan freeman ) is a man who has nearly given up on the world . its easy to see why . the world doesn \\' t make sense . ( somerset drives this point home with a rather ghastly story of a robbery victim who was attacked just blocks from the police precinct . after knocked down and robbed of his wallet , the attacker stabbed the helpless man in both eyes . ) why should somerset believe that by following this murder investigation and \" picking up the pieces \" he will be able to catch the killer ? somersets new partner , david mills ( brad pitt ) has not given up on the world , perhaps because he is still young ( and perhaps by having this optimism he \\' s naive in this films portrayal of the world ) . he completely disagrees with somersets abandonment of hope . however , david \\' s wife ( gwyneth paltrow ) has so much fear of her urban surroundings , she isn \\' t even sure if she wants to * tell * her husband about her recent pregnancy , let alone carry it until birth and attempt to raise it in this environment . these three characters are all performed with skill and authenticity that makes them feel like real people and not the typical hollywood characters a lesser film might have offered . and in addition to making clear how each of these characters sees the world , fincher gives us support for * why * they feel the way they do . but if there \\' s one character that underlines the message seven is trying to convey , it has to be the killer , john doe ( kevin spacey ) . seven \\' s payoff lies in its ability to allow us to see how the killer views the world and what drives him to do what he does . one important thing to remember about doe is how easy it is to simply dismiss him as a \" psycho , \" with no motives behind his slayings . this is exactly the mistake mills makes . in the extremely intense and superbly performed closing scenes , were allowed to see that doe is , in his mind , merely a product of society . he \\' s a killer who kills those who are bringing society down . in his mind he didn \\' t kill \" innocent \" people , and , perhaps , they were not completely innocent ( but , then again , who is ? ) . hes absolutely infuriated that mills believes that the murder victims were innocent . really , seven doesn \\' t just comment on the superficial obviousness of how screwed - up john doe is . seven makes larger statements about how screwed - up society is , hinting that society \\' s degradation is simply conducive of creating more john does . besides the stylistic and larger - issue arguments for seeing this film , i recommend seven because it is , after all , also a very slick and well - made thriller . it features exciting plot developments , commanding performances , lots of suspense , and a conclusion that is chilling , riveting , and quite unfair . but then again , its a cruel world .',\n",

       " ('a movie like mortal kombat : annihilation works ( and must be reviewed on ) multiple levels . first , there \\' s the rampant usage of randian subtext that pervades the entire movie . but occasionaly , almost as if making an ironic , self - depreciating remark , the movie tosses in clearly marxist imagery . no no . . . just kidding . had you going there for a moment , didn \\' t i ? in all seriousness however , and to be fair to the movie , it * is * necessary to provide two viewpoints : that of a movie watcher unfamiliar ( or only marginally familiar ) with the whole mortal kombat phenomenon , and that of a fan of the first movie and / or a fan of the games . the first movie ( mortal kombat ( 1995 ) ) concerned itself with a martial arts tournament that would decide the fate of earth ( and it \\' s 5 billion inhabitants ) . the mortals won , and in theory this should have prevented the emperor shao khan from taking over the earth . unfortunately , shao khan was a poor loser , and the very final scene in mortal kombat showed him arriving anyway , ready to take over the planet , as our heroes assumed a fighting stance . the first movie was extraordinarily entertaining for those ( like myself ) who are fans of the game . i \\' d even go so far as to say that many folks who didn \\' t know about the game probably enjoyed the movie . the writers and directors knew the limitations of both their cast and of the basic story itself , and they didn \\' t try to overachieve . there were a lot of really cool fight scenes ( with really cool accompanying music ) , intersperesed with some distracting ( but ultimately non - intrusive ) bits of fluff passing itself off as a plot . and , as we know , the movie was a smashing success at the box office . mortal kombat : annihilation picks up precisely where that movie left off , with some introductory exposition to clue in those who may not have seen the first movie . shao khan has decided that he \\' s going to take over the earth * anyways * , and to hell with some silly rule about mortals winning the tournament . thereafter follows approximately 85 minutes of film that alternates between being confused , being trite , being silly , and being just plain stupid . one gets the general impression that the producers of the movie thought \" hey , that last movie was such a success that we can get more money and make a * real * movie now . \" too bad they didn \\' t simply stick with the formula from the first movie . i could write volumes about the things that are wrong with this picture , but here are the high points : * the acting is truly bad . sandra hess ( playing the sonya blade character ) is particularly execrable , especially in scenes where she tries to convince us that she loved johnny cage ( a character from the first movie who gets greased at the beginning of this movie ) . * in one of the worst pieces of mis - casting i think i \\' ve * ever * seen , james remar plays raiden , the god of thunder . in the first movie , christopher lambert played raiden and played his character as though he was in on the joke : a french actor playing a japanese thunder god being revered by chinese mystics . i generally like it when actors are cast against type ( tim \" tiny \" lister , jr . being cast as the president of the u . s . in the fifth element , for example ) , and remar has always been one of my favorite \" utility \" actors but he \\' s so totally wrong for this part that he doesn \\' t even have the luxury of amused self - awareness . * there are too many characters that are introduced as being potentially important , but then never seen again . * there are a number of completely meaningless story sidetracks , including a muddled scene where liu kang ( robin shou ) seeks out nightwolf ( litefoot ) , has a mystical hallucination , and then wanders off with jade ( irina pantaeva ) . for these reasons ( and many others ) , i can only give the movie a 2 . . . . . . unless you \\' re a huge fan of the games and / or the first movie . in that case , the following critiques also apply : * sandra hess , while being an even worse actress than bridgette wilson ( who played sonya blade in the first movie ) , is much more convincing as a fighter . wilson looked like she was simply mimicing some movements taught to her by the fight choreographer . hess looks like she actually knows some martial arts , and puts together a much more believable fight scene . * in the fights , each of the characters does at least * one * thing they do in the game ( and often more ) . sonya does her \" kiss of death , \" jax does his \" earthquake , \" liu kang does his \" animality , \" and so on . a big bonus for those of us who were looking for similar moves in the first movie and found them only rarely . * there aren \\' t as many fight scenes in this movie as there were in the first , because the folks making the movie mistakenly try to hang a more robust plot in between . silly , silly folks . and the lamest fight involved two of the women in what turns into a mud - wrestling match . lame and so obviously sexist even i ( politically incorrect , for the most part ) noticed and remarked upon it . * the special effects are generally better , except for the final fight scene between the emporer and liu kang in which both perform their \" animalities . \" motaro and sheeva are both more convincing and lifelike than goro was in the first movie . for folks like myself who loved the first movie and enjoy the games , i give this a 5 . you \\' ll probably like it , but not nearly as much as you liked the first one .',\n",

       " ('when i was growing up in 1970s , boys in my school used to divide into two groups , based on their action movies preferences . the first one , myself included , liked movies that featured spectacular car chases , lots of machinegun fire and huge explosions . the latter one preferred hong kong martial arts flicks , probably because they could ( or , to be more precise , thought they could ) imitate its stunts in the real life . decades later , while refining my own cinematic taste , i began to appreciate and actually like those movies , probably because of overexposure to shoot - em - up idiocy of 1980s ramboids . yes , most of the kung fu and other \" martial arts \" flicks were cheap , they had predictable and formulaic plot , and asked very little of production values aside from martial arts skills . but , in the same time , those movies had their own rules and in the hands of capable director could become a terrific guilty pleasure and source of relaxation . the best of those movies , one that passed the test of time and managed to keep its own cult status after quarter of century was enter the dragon . made in 1973 in a joint hong kong - hollywood venture , it was intended to bring bruce lee \\' s skills and kung fu philosophy to the western audience . it succeeded , but it is still debatable whether by its own merit or by the unfortunate and mysterious death of bruce lee that immortalised the myth about that actor . lee plays a quiet shaolin monk who is a martial arts expert . he is approached by interpol official who asks him to join tri - annual martial arts tournament that is held on a remote island , owned and controlled by han , renegade shaolin monk . interpol suspects that the martial arts business is just cover for narcotics , gun - running and prostitution operations and lee must find the evidence necessary for authorities to intervene . lee accepts the mission because of personal reasons - o \\' harra , han \\' s brutal bodyguard was responsible for the tragic death of lee \\' s sister years ago . the island is also destination of two colourful martial arts experts from us - williams ( played by jim kelly ) is black activist running from the racist police , and his friend roper wants to make money in order to pay gambling debts . the plot of enter the dragon was in many ways influenced by james bond ( the 007 franchise itself would return favour by using kung fu elements in the man with the golden gun two years later ) . the main hero was faced against a power - hungry megalomaniac on a remote island , alone against whole army of bad guys . on the other hand , lee was more believable hero than bond ; deprived of guns and super - tech gadgets , he had to rely only on his personal skills in order to survive . in the same time , the plot , although extremely thin , allowed him even some internal battles - between the natural instinct to avenge his sister and his own anti - violent philosophy . the latter provided some opportunities to evaluate lee \\' s acting skills and some new elements to his impressive screen presence . although two other main actors - john saxon being the obligatory good white guy and jim kelly being the obligatory black good guy - were intended to share top spot with lee , they served as nothing more than a comic relief . it is a real shame to see kelly , definitely the worse actor than saxon , to steal the scenes from him only because his lines , being the worst possible blaxploitation cliches , sound so damn over the top . other actors , not including shih kien who turns han into typical , although not very convincing bondian villain , are nothing more than fist fodder for bruce lee ( among them is young jackie chan ) . fighting scenes are still impressive today as they were 25 years ago , although they mostly lack gore associated with that genre . in many way they are also more realistic ( they were personally staged by lee himself ) , demanding only a blow or two to incapacitate or kill the opponent . i \\' m not a martial arts expert nor the martial arts fan , but comparing those scenes with typical scenes today i simply can \\' t avoid to appreciate the difference from today \\' s movie fights when masses of bloody pulp manage to get up from the floor and win in the end . so , despite all the obvious flaws that preclude this movie of being top 100 of all times , enter the dragon is a incredibly entertaining piece of cinema and the martial arts flick that can be enjoyed even by those who don \\' t like that particular genre .',\n",

       " ('i remember hearing about this film when it first appeared at cannes over a year ago , picking up the grand jury prize at the festival . \\' holocaust comedy receives standing ovation \\' , the headlines read . intrigued by this statement , i looked up information on the film and found that , sure enough , life is beautiful is in fact a comedy about the greatest atrocity of the last thousand years . even though the movie was extremely well - received by critics and public alike , i couldn \\' t help but be disgusted at this notion ; human tragedy is not something i feel should be celebrated . only now do i see the error of my ways . after finally viewing the film for myself after avoiding it for some time , it became clear that it is not , as the headlines proclaimed , a \" holocaust comedy \" ; on the contrary , life is beautiful does not even really depict the graphic events that took place in nazi deathcamps . rather , it focuses on the relationship between a father and his son , who he is trying desperately to shield from the horrors of their situation . roberto benigni ( who also wrote and directed the movie ) stars as guido orefice , a chaplin - inspired clown and all round jolly guy who , as the film opens , is vying for the affections of an attractive school teacher ( nicoletta braschi , benigni real life spouse ) . through the course of the first hour or so , we see guido striving to get the attention of this \" beautiful princess \" , as he calls her . employing the magic of laughter , the italian comedian wins her heart and together , they raise a young boy named giosue ( child actor giorgio cantarini ) . life treats them well until hitler \\' s minions rise to power , and the family is whisked away to a german camp , where guido becomes convinced that he must upholds his son \\' s innocence no matter what the sacrifice . granted , it contains some uproariously funny moments both in and out of the concentration camp , but it does not pull a \" hogan \\' s heros \" and make light of the slaughtering of some six million innocent jews . somehow , it achieves hilarity without disrespecting it \\' s gravely serious subject . so , we \\' ve established that life is beautiful is not a \" holocaust comedy \" . but , there is another complete misrepresentation of this material that really disturbs me . the film , despite critic \\' s declarations of it being a \" triumph of the human spirit \" , is no such thing ; not in my eyes , anyway . some have called the story an \" affirmation of the beauty of life \" , but i say it is a very dark and bleak statement about man \\' s capability of denial masquerading as an endearing comedy . the film \\' s ending has been recognized as the most entirely uplifting moment of any film released recently , but i found it to be truly discerning and upsetting . essentially , life is beautiful is quite possibly the greatest hoax in the history of film . however , i am not denying the movie \\' s greatness . believe me , it \\' s fantastic . i \\' m just saying that i think benigni did something different than what most people are interpreting it as . but perhaps i \\' m reading more into the movie than is really there . maybe the film \\' s brilliance relies on the idea that the viewer can interpret the meaning of it in any way they see fit . in fact , maybe roberto benigni has made a film that is the sole argument for the old saying that you get out of a movie exactly what you put into it .',\n",

       " ('many people dislike french films for their lack of closure . while possibly shallow , i \\' ve often had a desire for a sense of epiphany , or at least a resolution , in the films which i view . there is no revelation in un coeur en hiver in the traditional ; however , the film is incredibly successful in its passionate dramatization of a passion - denying protagonist , stephane ( daniel auteuil ) . stephane ( daniel auteuil ) is a master violin maker . he is passionless about all that which surrounds him except his craft and the music which his craft is responsible for producing . even the relationship between he and his boss , maxime ( andre dussollier ) is a controlled , and almost manipulated association , highlighted by the fact that stephane permits maxime to win close squash matches . in the beginning of the movie , stephane is a closed , solitary individual and the audience is carefully left to wonder about the depth of emotion behind this enigmatic man . camille kessler ( emmanuelle beart ) is a master violinist and the new love of maximes . maxime is so much in love with camille that he plans to and does leave his wife . like stephane , camille is outwardly very controlled and reserved , sacrificing all thought and emotion to her violin and the music which emerges . when stephane and camille meet , there is a recognition of a bonding by both individuals . however , whereas camille submits to the wild interplay of emotions which she now feels for stephane , stephane only admits that camille is attracted to him . stephane ignores his feelings for camille , which the audience cannot help but to see is present . as the movie progresses , the two characters become more and more polarized in their views and emotions for one another . these two people , with very similar approaches to life initially , react to their new circumstance very differently . stephane becomes even more rational and controlled , while camille becomes more tempestuous , until she almost borders on suffering a nervous breakdown due to the inability to consummate their relationship . however , their approach to each other is perhaps not surprising considering their vocation . the audience is led to believe that stephane may have been a genius as a violinist as well , due to his relationship with a master violin teacher . however , apparently , he could not be a violinist due to his intolerance for flaws in his playing . consequently , stephane becomes a precision craftsmen with the instrument and no longer plays . in contrast , camille had almost given the violin , years earlier . however , with the aid of her manager , she has progressed to being almost one of the world \\' s finest , successfully submerging herself to her playing . during the course of the movie , we see both characters evolve as they struggle to meet the challenge of their new emotions . stephane attempts to remain unchanged . however , we do see subtle hints of his transformation . one of the most obvious is when he defeats maxime in squash . the development of all of the characters , many of which is not included in this synopsis , is incredible . american movies , with rare exceptions , have not and i would daresay cannot approach foreign films in character development . in its essence , this movie is about the development and growth of the characters , camille and stephane . the portrayal of all the other characters in the movie , including a death , is to further the development of camille \\' s and stepahne \\' s characters . i am not sure why berardinelli says , \" at times it becomes difficult to determine whether stephane should be pitied or vilified , and it is to auteuil \\' s credit that he manages to maintain this uncertainty . \" this movie is not about judging stephane \\' s actions as being right or wrong , but about viewing their growth and accepting the characters as who they are . i find the ending appropriate ; unfortunately , i found the last ten minutes which led up to the final scene to be very unfulfilling . this portion of the film is where the \" sense of closure \" could have been successfully accomplished . unfortunately , there is a hurried and almost a soap opera - type surge of emotions from all of the characters . while ravel may not be quite as accomplished as schubert or mozart , ravel has his day in this film . the synergism of the tension of ravel \\' s music and tension on the screen is the best i have ever seen . the directing in this movie is wonderful . the actors and actresses are excellent , each playing their part with great sincerity and warmth . emmanuelle beart \\' s personality is beautiful . and needless to say , i must say that emmanuelle beart , herself , is beautiful . besides the near ending , the only other criticism of the movie which i have is that the movie is almost too cerebral . i almost left with the sense little happened because almost all the changes which occur in the movie happen in deep in their psyches and little in their personalities or the situations which they end as part of . the one question which i am left with is while they have accepted their lot , has their attitude towards love changed ? i have several possibilities which i believe the movie hints at , but i am unsure of which the director is espousing . in summary , this movie is solely about the character growth of two characters who almost develop a relationship . in the process , we see their attitude towards life and other people . in itself , i do not believe un coeur is a complicated movie . where it does become complicated is when we juxtapose the scenes of the movie into the greater walk of life where we , as americans , have preconceived american notions of relationship , love , and people . i do wonder how the movie translates when viewed within its native french culture . however , i , bringing my american preconceptions , enjoyed the film . i would welcome any comments about this movie from any who have seen it .',\n",

\\' - see , that \\' s provocative , leaves room for further questions . \" ) the film enjoys a few inspired moments - the urn scene , a session of nude bowling , the policeman joining in on terry and nick \\' s acid trip - but unfortunatetely these instances are few and far between , and for the most part the humour in dream with the fishes registers more as attempts rather than actual successes . this occurs particularly often during the film \\' s opening sequence - as terry is wrestling the bedridden nick for his watch in the hospital , i \\' m realising that this is * intended * to be funny , although nary a smile crept upon my lips - which is probably due to the obvious fact that it \\' s painfully clear to the audience from the outset that terry is going to be thwarted in his initial suicide attempts , sapping any element of surprise or amusement from nick \\' s scheme of tricking him ; this is not a film which has the wherewithal to kill off its leading star in the opening ten minutes . the entire sequence is , then , clearly an exercise for character exposition , with attempts at humour terribly diminished by utter predictability . among the cast , coming off best is david arquette , the current master in the portrayal of meek , squirming , stammering fresh - faced characters - he would have been terrific as the lead for george huang \\' s swimming with sharks - who gets to apply his adeptness for timidity as terry . mr . taylor ambitiously employs an interesting visual technique , where the portions of the film set in an urban environment have been processed to appear extremely grainy and heavily saturated , as opposed to a bright , crisp look for the smalltown scenes . the charge of dream with the fishes \\' s protagonists being wholly unempathetic is a bit of an odd one coming from me ; i seem to have a predilection for films with unlikeable characters , and indeed , in many cases have i been in the minority , supporting films which have been condemned as interminable due to the difficult , audience - unfriendly nature of their characters . for dream with the fishes , though , i did find myself on the flip side of coin , often hoping that the film would quickly conclude , and that the nick character would just hurry up and die .',\n",

       " ('reindeer games is easily the worst of the three recent films penned by ehren kruger ( scream 3 and arlington rd are the others , each derivative in their own special way ) . the guy can \\' t seem to write believable dialogue ( sample from reindeer games : \" rule # 1 : never put a car thief behind the wheel \" ) , create multi - faceted characters , or even engineer coherent plots but he sure knows how to pile on numerous nonsensical twists and turns ( no matter if each one deems the actual story increasingly unlikely ) . his screenplay for reindeer games turns the tables on the audience so many times that watching the film becomes something of a punishment with no reward anywhere in sight . i can just envision kruger laughing behind his keyboard , \" oh you thought my movie was gonna go here , f * ck you jack ass , take that twist , decipher this mother f * cker ! \" it \\' s almost as if the writer were angry at us for shelling out money to see his stupid movie . and why the hell would anyone want to invest time in a movie when the screenwriter keeps changing his own rules for no reason other than to congratulate himself on how damn clever he is ? auteur theory be damned ; it \\' s kruger \\' s \" style \" , not the director \\' s that winds up on screen . kruger has obviously never paid much mind to the old chestnut \" sometimes less is more \" . and his numerous twists can \\' t even claim to be originals ; arlington rd \\' s ending is a direct steal from the much better alan j . pakula thriller the parallax view , and in reindeer games we get this ol \\' gem ; character incriminates themself by saying something they shouldn \\' t know ( pronouns used to protect the gender of the \" character \" . . . grammar be damned ) . \" how did you know that ? \" the stunned protagonist asks , suddenly realizing that the character was in on the whole thing all along . . . since twist endings are currently so in vogue , and seeing as how kruger \\' s screenplays usually come equipped with about three twists per ending , i guess it \\' s no wonder why he works so frequently . he \\' s quickly becoming miramax \\' s mickey mouse ; the company has already signed him to work on several of their upcoming projects . this is appropriate considering that miramax ( which used to place their label on some of the most artistically daring films ) has quickly become a grindhouse for coddling foreign imports ( life is beautiful ) and freddie prinze jr . vehicles . their company \\' s current logo could be \" we ride the trends \" . reindeer games stars ben affleck as rudy , a supposedly hardened criminal spending his days and nights behind bars with fantasies of pecan pies dancing atop his head . although affleck is given some barbed wire tattoos to insinuate bad assness , he plays the role like steve guttenberg preciously mugging through a police academy flick . affleck is such a puppy dog that it \\' s impossible to believe he could survive in a harsh prison environment without becoming nearly everyone \\' s bitch . the role itself is so badly written ( the character only grows balls when the plot calls for it ) , the twists so outrageous , and the directing so self consciously gritty that this is about as close to self parody as i can recall a recent \" serious \" movie getting . it may have been wiser had the film makers simply went all the way in that direction , casting jerry seinfeld as the hardened criminal and howard stern as the sniveling bad guy ( who \\' s played here by gary sinise in yet another over the top villain performance ) james frain is nick , rudy \\' s cellmate , a manslaughterer who \\' s found a pen pal in the gorgeous ashley mason ( charlize theron ) . ashley is a prison groupie who sends nick many cheesecake photos of her though she \\' s never seen one picture of him . which works out fine since the character is killed in a near - riot , and rudy ( who was to be paroled on the same day as nick ) takes his place , which leads to a sudden and very frenzied sex scene between ashley and rudy ( so frenzied it kinda looks like rape ) and a surprise visit from ashley \\' s brother , gabriel ( gary sinise ) , who waltzes into their shabby hotel room flanked by his thuggish co - horts . he plans to rob an indian casino on christmas eve with the assistance of rudy who he thinks is nick who , according to what he wrote in the letters to ashley , used to work as a guard in the indian casino . though by the end , the film pulls the rug out from under us so frequently that everything i \\' ve described might as well be irrelevant . this is what you can expect should you chose to take this reindeer on ; several scenes in which , after catching his prey , the bad guy proceeds to stall interminably until the good guy has a chance to kill his captor and crack a stupid one - liner . included : two ( 2 ) scenes of two ( 2 ) different bad guys explaining their motives to the hero when they should be killing him ( one following the other no less ) . though it \\' s an action film , the ending is more a talkfest where we get the whole movie explained to us by one flustered character actor after another while affleck looks on , incredulous as the audience . the flick was directed by john frankenheimer , a straightforward action director who lucked into the manchurian candidate early in his career , fell off the a - list following a string of flops and now , in his old age , is slowly climbing his way back up . it would be a success story if he were choosing better scripts but his last major film was ronin ( one of those almost but not quite movies ) which followed the island of dr . morneau ( you remember , the one with marlon brando in mime make - up and a not so flattering moo - moo ) , and now this . he films action sequences with a minimum of quick cutting which i like considering that nowadays action scenes are commonly comprised of millisecond flash cuts strung together and laid out for a brain - zapped mtv audience to pick apart . problem is these action scenes ( nearly all failed escapes ) serve no purpose in the story other than to further pad out the running time and to remind the audience that their watching an action movie rather than a filmed radio play . character problems abound ; rudy is made to shift between sweet boy next door earnestness and hard edged wiseacre , the latter of which is not ( at least at this point ) something ben affleck is capable of pulling off . the former he can do with ease and often the actor coasts on his lackadaisical charm while those around him growl and swear . but then suddenly affleck starts growling and swearing alongside them like the class clown imitating a tarantino gangster . charlize theron , an extraordinary talent , is , like affleck , playing whatever part the script requires her to play , whether it be vulnerability at one moment , anger at the next . she never has a chance to evince any charm or make much of an impression beyond her obvious physical attributes ( frankenheimer has her needlessly pop her top to further italicize this . gary sinise has played this role frequently , and here , as in snake eyes , he does the snarling bad guy thing with such over the top vitriol ( the guy must be so incredibly bored of stomping through the same paces that going out of control is the only thing that keeps him interested any more ) , that it becomes more of an annoyance ( oh there he goes again ? ? ? ) than a threat . these are talented people who made the mistake of jumping on to a script with little but stock characters and a bag of tricks that it dully springs on its audience .',\n",

       " ('it was with great trepidation that i approached + mary + , the farrelly brothers + latest film . i knew the film would be funny -- the trailer alone had me laugh harder than the actual comedy i went to see . but i also knew the film would be an equal - opportunity offender , attacking the sensibilities of the politically correct with reckless abandon . i figured the film would be raunchy , maybe another lucky escapee from nc - 17 hell . i may laugh , but would i feel better in the morning ? i needn + t have worried . + mary + is the sweetest , warmest , all - out laugh - and - grossfest this side of _animal house_ . surprisingly , the farrelly brothers have walked that very tight line of making a touching romantic comedy on the side , and filling the details with five or six outrageous howlers . they make laughter , the toughest job for a filmmaker to do , look easy . the plot is typical . thirteen years ago , geeky ted ( ben stiller ) lucked out in having dazzling mary ( cameron diaz ) go with him to the senior prom . as luck would have it , on that very day , he was hospitalized . why , i shall not tell , but i assure you , it isn + t pretty . he hires a private investigator to find her : pat healy ( matt dillon ) . he becomes one of the great comic villains . upon finding her , he too is lovestruck , and so pursues her , lying about his occupation and getting his teeth capped . it is only a matter of time before ted finds out that he had been double - crossed , and goes to get her for himself . would the geek get the girl ? puh - lease . the ending is pure hollywood ; no surprises there . but the absolute joy in this film is how this simple premise allows for humor in zippers , hair gel , the mentally disabled , the physically handicapped , interracial marriages , homosexuals , skin conditions , serial killers , tanning , and drugged - up dogs . the dog on speed sequence alone is worth the price of admission , and belongs in the film comedy hall of fame . and yet , for all the targets that are hit , the film maintains its sweet tone . mary , playing the straight role , is as sweet and caring as she is beautiful . she is totally devoted to caring for her mentally handicapped brother , warren ( w . earl brown -- miles away from the cameraman in _scream_ ) . mary + s sunniness carries the film here -- it compliments the below - belt gags that come at you . cameron diaz makes her totally charming , and the audience respects her , even though women in general do not usually undress before an open window . ben stiller also fares very well , totally changing his image from his _reality bites_ and _flirting with disaster_ straight men to being a , ( how to say it ? ) , a complete loser . braces , greasy long hair , not too bright , and very very funny . dillon is exceptionally creepy , especially with his capped teeth . and rounding out the cast is ted + s friend dom ( chris elliot ) , tanning addict magda ( lin shaye ) , modern troubador / greek chorus ron lichman , and mary + s sweet mom , markie post ( where has she been ? ! ) . not everything works . chris elliot + s role , skin blemishes and all , becomes merely tasteless and boring . there + s lousy dialogue about eight - minute vs . seven minute exercise tapes . and there are long stretches without much going on . but the wait is worth it . when those extraordinary sequences hit , the entire theater erupted with howls , tears . belly - aches , that in some sequences carried over to the following scene . the farrelly brothers have finally done it . yes , there are some raunchy bits , but when it is all over , it + s not nearly as bad as it could have been . while tasteless , it didn + t cross any lines , at least not with me . while raunchy , it wasn + t nearly as bad as _porky + s_ or _boogie nights_ . and it is sweet enough to be considered a date flick . after the funny but sour _kingpin_ left a negative aftertaste in my palate , comes the funniest sex farce since _a fish called wanda_ . approach this with an open mind , and you will reap the benefits hugely .',\n",

       " (\"retelling the classic story of joan of arc has been a popular trend this year . earlier this may , leelee sobieski played the passionate title role in the top - rated miniseries that debuted on cbs . and now , director luc besson has delivered his version of the sweeping epic about the teenage girl supposedly sent by god to rescue france from the clutches of their enemies . starring milla jovovich , who is predominantly unconvincing as the heavenly messenger accused of being a witch , ` the messenger : the story of joan of arc ' is a disjointed and overblown historical re - enactment that prevails merely as a bloated mistreatment of the famous legend . besson ( who ' s previous work includes the hyperactive sci - fi ` the fifth element ' ) perhaps entrusted a bit too much faith in ex - wife jovovich , because in ` the messenger ' , the actress is drowning in a pool of her own inexperience . at first , when reports were indicating that jovovich had been chosen for such a demanding role , i was highly doubtful that her marginal talent could carry a film of such a caliber . after seeing the rousing trailer , my hesitant optimism suddenly skyrocketed - milla jovovich looked superb . with the hopeful propulsion of her stellar performance , ` the messenger ' looked like a timeless epic in the making . a timeless epic it is not . besson is hesitant to abandon his unique and flashy style , and the story behind ` the messenger ' is not entirely suited to his demands . on the shoulders of besson ' s choppy and unexciting direction , the film dissipates into an uninspiring hodgepodge of poorly executed battle sequences and bizarre imagery . there is no human exploration into the character of joan ( or jeanne ) . jovovich merely rambles on about the power of god when we have little or no insight into her visionary objective . jovivich ' s unsatisfying portrayal only helps lead to the realization that besson sees jeanne as a piece of spiritual cardboard . she is just another special effect in this continuous visual feast . jovovich does have a few isolated moments of sheer power , but mainly , she looks lost . quite frankly , i don ' t know of any actress who could successfully navigate her way through ` the messenger ' without a major fumble . the script is chock - full of laughable dialogue and unfortunate comedy , as jeanne confronts the uncrowned king charles vii ( john malkovich ) and informs him of her heavenly intentions . faye dunaway plays charles ' overbearing mother - in - law , and dustin hoffman appears over two - hours into the story as a character dubbed ? the conscience ' . all three actors juggle limited screen time , although malkovich is uncharacteristically awful . the battle scenes are extremely bloody , but with the presence of such jittery camera work , they capture none of the excitement or finesse of something like ` braveheart ' . there ' s a particularly graphic and unsettling scene early on , when jeanne ( as a young girl ) watches in horror from a closet as her older sister is murdered and then savagely raped by a bloodthirsty english soldier . even his fellow troopers are petrified . ` the messenger ' is also strictly a 90 ' s update on the classic story . almost too 90 ' s , it seems . there ' s gratuitous use of the f - word and a barrage of slang terms like ` she ' s nuts ! ' sprinkled throughout the screenplay . i was half - expecting jeanne to invite her homeys to come chill in her crib , but it never happened . there ' s also the familiar presence of bizarre besson humor , but none of it comes even remotely close to functioning properly . it seems terribly misplaced , but in a catastrophe as jumbled and disjointed as ` the messenger ' , almost everything does . the musical score by erric serra is spectacular , and the set and production designs are continuously impressive . if it was visual excellence that besson was striving for , then he achieves his goal . but the only time the dramatics come alive in ` the messenger ' is during the closing trial , in which jeanne is found guilty and burned at the stake . during these moments , the historical relevance and dramatic purpose of joan of arc reaches the audience , albeit in a faint stream of light that provokes little power or meaning . it ' s just too delayed for besson to revive his lifeless interpretation , in which he is always concerned with the wrong aspects . ` the messenger : the story of joan of arc ' is an unlikely and unwelcome historical addition to the hollywood shelf . anyone searching for an entertaining epic is going to be painfully slapped with an overblown and confusing film . despite my original hopefulness , milla jovovich is not going to have to worry about thanking the academy .\",\n",

       " ('ok , let \\' s get one thing straight right away : maximum risk is no battleship potemkin ( although it does have some russians in it ! ) , but it \\' s not too bad , really . it \\' s the new film from ringo lam , the latest hong kong filmmaker to defect to hollywood , and stars that minor league schwartzeneggar from belgium , jean - claude van damme ( who , you will recall , also starred in john woo \\' s maiden hollywood effort , hard target ) . in lam \\' s film , van damme plays alain moreau , a french cop ( at least his accent makes more sense here than it did in hard target ) who discovers that he was separated shortly after birth from a twin brother who was adopted by russians . these russians defected to the united states and moved into a black neighbourhood in new york ( where , i suppose , they thought they wouldn \\' t be noticed ) . this brother , mikhail suverov ( played in his few scenes by . . . well , you know ) , becomes deeply involved in the russian mafia and the fbi ( almost the same thing , i guess ) , and is killed in france ( in the movie , things happen so fast that you don \\' t have too much time to think about how weird this all is ) . moreau does what any good surviving twin brother would do and goes to new york to find out why mikhail was killed , and why everyone in france who knows anything about him is also being killed ( we wonder the same thing ; i still do ) . in little odessa , he meets mikhail \\' s girlfriend , alex ( natasha henstridge , last seen in species ) , who helps him solve the mystery and adds immeasurably to the mise - en - scene ( she has very nice breasts , and we get to seen them briefly in this movie ; it was rated r in the us but is pg here , so they must have seen more of her breasts than we do ) . this film lacks the gloss and high production values of such other action movies as broken arrow , the fugitive , hard target , or anything starring arnold , but that works to its benefit , i think . after all , one thing that \\' s been missing from woo \\' s hollywood films is that certain hong kong funkiness that we all know and love ( well , some of us do ) . movies like this shouldn \\' t be too pretentious , and that is part of the problem with some of these other films : they try to be too \" big \" in terms of special effects and sheer spectacle . maximum risk has its share of car chases and explosions , but they don \\' t overwhelm the movie or detract our attention from the narrative ( not too much , anyway ) . the emphasis throughout is on the characters and their interactions ( even if , at times , they don \\' t make a hell of a lot of sense ) . in fact , one of the more interesting aspects of the film is a minor character , a rather overeager new york cabbie ( frank van keeken from tv \\' s \" kids in the hall \" ) , who begins as something of a joke but becomes an important part of the story . unfortunately , by the time we have come to really get interested in him , he . . . well , you \\' ll see . the movie also features some set pieces of the type that we have come to expect from lam and his hong kong compatriots . one is a fight in a russian sauna , with lots of sweaty , muscular male flesh ( this one will appeal to certain parts of the audience more than others ) , bullets in heads , and vodka . another , my personal favorite , is a fight in a meat packing house , featuring pig carcasses and a chainsaw . and even the predictable car chases are more hong kong than hollywood , as they trash those quaint french cafes , vegetable carts , and , well , french people that , we all know in our hearts , deserve trashing just for being so damn quaint . of course , the movie does have its share of silliness . for example , while beating the crap out of an obnoxious russian thug who obviously deserves what he \\' s getting , alain stops long enough to look at his own reflection in the cracked mirror with which he has been whacking the guy on the head . in an unnecessarily dramatic moment , he apparently is shocked at what he sees , at what he has become . but what has he become ? a tough cop who beats the hell out of a guy who tried to kill him ? doesn \\' t sound too unreasonable to me , considering the genre . but let \\' s face it , any time van damme tries to be dramatic , he looks silly . so maximum risk is a little different from most other action films . while watching it , i was surprised , and a little disappointed , in the relative lack of pyrotechnics . but watching some of these other action films is sort of like experiencing a sugar rush ; after the initial excitement , there \\' s not much left . although it \\' s short on spectacle , lam \\' s film leaves a better and more lasting impression , i think . i \\' m more impressed by it now than i was while watching it , and to me , that \\' s a good sign . go see maximum risk , but don \\' t expect a typical hollywood action movie ; expect a sort of funky hong kong - hollywood action movie . the flying inkpot rating system : * wait for the tv2 broadcast . * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! * * * pretty good , bring a friend . * * * * amazing , potent stuff . * * * * * perfection . see it twice . dr t . white teaches film at the english language and literature department of the national university of singapore , but we don \\' t hold this against him .',\n",

       " ('slavery is bad . after hundreds of years , we \\' ve finally figured that one out . this almost universal belief is the both the strength and weakness of director steven spielberg \\' s latest \" serious \" film . during the late 1830s , a portuguese slave ship carries a cargo of black men and women kidnapped from their home on africa \\' s west coast to cuba to be sold into slavery . fifty - three of them are stuffed into the \" la amistad \" ( from a spanish word for \" friendship \" ) by their new spanish owners . freeing himself from his chains , senge pieh ( djimon hounsou ) , renamed cinque by his masters , leads a bloody revolt . after killing most of the crew , the africans force the remaining sailors to return them to their home - or so they think . instead the ship heads up the coast to the united states . the amistad is boarded by an american naval ship and the revolutionaries are put on trial in connecticut for murder and piracy . the legal question becomes are they free men fighting justly for their freedom or are they property . if they are property , who do they belong to ? their masters ? the spanish government ? salvage rights of the officers who captured the ship ? the us government ? the defendants are pawns in several games . abolitionists theodore joadson ( morgan freeman ) and lewis tappan ( stellan skarsgard ) want to free them , but tappan sees them primarily as a means to further the cause . their lawyer roger baldwin ( matthew mcconaughey ) views the case as a simple one of property rights and a chance to make his share of legal fees . south carolina senator john c . calhoun ( arliss howard ) pursues the case for the political advancement of the southern states . president martin van buren ( nigel hawthorne ) is willing to force the result towards his own political ends . when the verdict looks to free the africans , van buren replaces the judge with one more sympathetic to his wishes . even that doesn \\' t work and the new judge frees the kidnap victims . at the urging of calhoun , the president then appeals the case to the supreme court , populated by a majority of slave - owners . this little - known ( try finding it in any history text book ) incident from america \\' s past would have gone down a darker path were it not for former president john quincy adams ( anthony hopkins ) who is persuaded to argue the case before the supreme court . the slavery issue is easy pickin \\' s for spielberg . much like his \" shindler \\' s list \" ( which followed \" jurassic park \" as this follows \" lost world \" ) , the moral sides are not difficult ones to choose . nazis and slave traders : both treat groups of others as less than human . it \\' s not hard to see who the bad guys are . without that question to ponder , the director \\' s job is more difficult . he has to make the story interesting . spielberg succeeds for the most part . the visual aspect of the film is beyond reproach . where the movie falls down is a bit more subtle . there are very few _people_ in the tale . in fact , cinque is the only character who is fleshed out . tappan and joadson are \" abolitionists \" : symbols but not humans . van buren is a weak politician but nothing else . the rest of the \" slaves \" barely exist other than dressing for the set . like many other films about people of color , almost all the major players are white . the film \\' s salvation lies in the acting strength of everyone involved and the powerful presence of hounsou . the former model \\' s first major role is a winner . without speaking more than five words of english , he conveys more emotion than most actors with a thousand lines of dialog . the other stand - out is hopkins who seems to be making a career out of portraying american presidents ( he also played the title role in \" nixon \" ) . the impassioned speech by the doddering old man who phases in and out of rationality is among the best court - room drama ever on the screen . there are some other great moments . especially impressive are the african \\' s struggle to understand what is going on in the strange land . their interpretation of the bible based solely on the pictures and their own experiences is poignant . as grand as the epic is , it would have more impact had it focused more on the experience from the point of view of the africans . more humanity in the fight for humanity would have made it a four - star film .

       " ('i \\' m not sure i should be writing a review of the witches of eastwick , because i \\' m not sure just what the hell ( pardon the expression ) was going on in it . however , i can express the most important observation i made of it , i . e . i didn \\' t like it . if i had to summarize this film , i think i \\' d conclude it was an updating of one of those old new england folk tales of someone selling their souls to old scratch and how they try to get out of the deal . that \\' s the kernel of it , anyway . tossed into this are little bits and pieces that occasionally seem to be saying something about men and women , feminism , the role of the devil , modern reformers , and friendship . unfortunately , little or no effort is ever made to follow up and elucidate on these concepts ; they \\' re simply thrown out and then left to rot while the film goes on apace . actually , i think that most of the audience was even more confused than i was . they came in expecting some kind of supernatural comedy , on the level of ghostbusters , and were a bit confused to be getting a folk tale with philosophical overtones . they laughed , or tried to laugh , at moments that were either barely funny , or much more horrible than funny , as if that could bend the film away from it \\' s rather frightening direction . three women ( cher , susan sarandon , and michelle pfieffer ) live in eastwick , a small midwestern town . one night , while drinking late into the evening , they begin wishing for the ideal man to drop into their lives . in seeming answer to their idle daydreams , a wealthy eccentric moves into a mansion on the hill and seduces each one by attempting to be everything they want him to be . he soon shows evidence of mystical -- perhaps demonic -- power , and his devotion to the women \\' s merest fantasies or wishes has dangerous overtones . even worse , when ignored his moods become ugly , and he mistreats the women for spurning him . anyway , the problems : all three female characters are fairly uninteresting , and several are cardboard stereotypes , especially sarandon \\' s character . we never get inside them , never feel sympathetic to them , because their dialogue and personalities seem pretty bland . as for nicholson , well , even the devil needs a direction to go in , and while darryl van horne is the most interesting character in the movie ( due to the grace of the screenwriter and , more importantly , nicholson \\' s acting ) , he still can \\' t be yanked in one direction and then another without making him a little vague . and then there \\' s the special effects . not in themselves -- they weren \\' t that good -- but their overuse . i was almost positive , until i saw the credits , that the witches of eastwick was either produced by alexander salkind ( who has turned out the slop named superman ii and iii and supergirl ) , because of the big name actors in dopy stunts , or stephen spielberg , after the 18th vomit scene and the nicholson - blown - down - the - street stunt . nope , it \\' s another bunch of guys , and directed by george miller , who has shown great skill with stunts / special effects before ( the road warrior , \" nightmare at 20 , 00 feet \" episode of twilight zone : the movie ) but apparently doesn \\' t know when to turn off the wind machine and let his people act . f \\' gawds sake , guys , this is jack nicholson ! let him loose ! let him grin demonically ! skip the splitting earth and fake lightning ! watching the scene where nicholson is tossed out of the car by the voodoo doll , all i could think of was , \" what a waste \" . if you \\' re going to use slapstick like that , use it up on pee wee herman . nicholson does what he can with the role , and when he can find his bearings , can be extremely good ( the scene in the church , for instance ) , but most of the time , he seems a bit stiff , as if he \\' s not sure what he should be doing next . and no wonder . this script goes all over the map , giving you the feeling that it \\' d just love to be allegory , but it \\' s not sure about what -- maybe if you give it time it \\' ll think of something . so what is the witches of eastwick ? a horror movie ? a folk tale ? a comedy ? a statement about women ? an examination of the religious right or comparitive morality ? i tend to think of the image that seems to dominate the movie for me . . . watching someone regurgitate half - digested bits of food and cherry pits all over rooms , people , the screen , and ultimately , the audience . in other words , a mess . ( $ 2 . 00 ) if you like nicholson enough to watch him here ; maybe 25 % of his charm is able to make it through the logjams of others .',\n",

       " (\"while watching boiler room , i was constantly reminded of last year ' s masterpiece fight club . both films consist of a predominately male cast . both films follow young men as they illicitly fight the traditional system for their own desires . and both films are seen through the eyes of one narrator , who eventually realizes that these men have to be stopped . while boiler room writer / director ben younger does not get his point across as well as david fincher does for fight club , he does contribute another impressive work to a series of films aiming to represent the new generation . a generation which has seen the internet prosper and where everyone wants to be a millionaire . paying homage to oliver stone ' s 1987 classic wall street , younger is almost modernizing the tale by using younger , hipper actors to play the greedy villains as opposed to the older , more experienced types . as is true in real life , younger minds are becoming richer and richer from their knowledge of more standard technology . boiler room dismisses the notion of ingenuity and shows that greed and desire for power come in all ages . another similarity with fight club is that both films are not action flicks . some people are convinced that an all - male cast automatically means there must be gory violence , here is proof that this is not true . if you want to see an action movie starring ben affleck , go see reindeer games this weekend . if you want to see a smart , insightful film with excellent acting and a clever script , see boiler room . giovanni ribisi gives an outstanding performance as the film ' s narrator , seth . after dropping out of college and running a lucrative gambling center for college students in his apartment , seth is offered a high paying job by a wealthy man ( nicky katt ) . he agrees to take the job ( in which you are guaranteed to become a millionaire within three years ) of selling stock to well - off americans from the mid - west over the telephone and begins to fit in quite well with his co - workers . learning tricky techniques to deceive innocent people into buying shares of a good in production , seth figures this is too good to be true . after stumbling into a room at the wrong time , he knows there is something no good about this company . at this point , seth is left with the ultimate choice ; continue with the american dream and make millions or tell the authorities that something fishy is going on . ribisi is believable as seth especially when he shares scenes with ron rifkin , playing seth ' s dad . the two have perfect chemistry as a troubled father and son trying to impress each other and simultaneously impress themselves . the transitions from anger to sympathy that these scenes contain are the standout segments of the entire film . the supporting cast of greedy co - workers is also flawless . ben affleck shines in a short but sweet performance as a recruiter for the company , nicky katt is fabulous as the ostensibly friendly boss who eventually becomes extremely jealous of seth , and vin diesel gives his best performance of his career as the foil character of nicky katt . the energy of the cast as a whole makes boiler room well paced and never boring . the only major error in the film is that nothing major happens . there is no big plot twist or climatic point to make the film more memorable . due to the lack of a major event , boiler room never finds a suitable genre to fit into . the movie is not intense enough to be a thriller , the romantic segments involving seth and abby ( nia long ) are not properly finalized , and the dialogue isn ' t funny enough to make it a comedy . in having trouble to characterize the movie as a whole , boiler room is slightly confused at times . it doesn ' t seem to know which category to fit itself into . one satisfying concluding scene could have changed the whole film for the better . otherwise , the movie is fun to watch thanks to its lively cast of young actors .\",\n",

( chris rock is this film \\' s only weak link - between jokes , he \\' s wooden . ) his no - frills visual style hasn \\' t changed much over the years , though ( dogma \\' s widescreen compositions at least have blockbuster affectations ) , nor has his writing - his characters still sit around delivering one caustic , hilarious speech after another . dogma chips away at big religious issues - namely , the hypocrisy that accompanies any organized system of beliefs - eloquently and articulately , but a few of the monologues sound too much like blatant exposition . as well , the verbal introduction of each new person seems to take forever . any movie with this much weighty talk would have a hard time maintaining momentum ( hurlyburly , anyone ? ) , and eventually dogma \\' s pacing goes slack . a long diatribe from bartleby late in the game , in which he laments the destiny of celestial beings , comes at a point when we \\' ve heard enough . because his change of heart ( bartleby is initially the good cop to loki \\' s bad ) drives the climax , said rant is given a great deal of screen time . sure , affleck deserved a big moment ( damon steals their scenes together prior ) , but it ultimately makes the film and us feel bloated . like tarantino , smith was a video - age sponge who became a sample - mad indie filmmaker . dogma pays welcome homage to an eclectic batch of movies , including indiana jones and the last crusade , with silent bob doing his best harrison ford , and weird science - a shit demon attacks our heroes ! smith also has a kitchen sink brand of humour : his dexterous maneuvering between the satirical ( a cardinal played by george carlin attempts to mount a publicity campaign with the slogan \" catholicism wow ! \" ) and the scatalogical ensures that no lover of comedy will leave dogma feeling malnourished . i bust ( ed ? ) a gut on several occasions . proceedings also get off on the right foot with the opening with the funniest disclaimer ever . it \\' s a disclaimer unlikely to put protestors at ease , for to read it , one actually has to see dogma . the prerelease ballyhoo is in the tradition of the last temptation of christ \\' s , martin scorsese \\' s 1988 adaptation of nikos kazantzakis \\' controversial novel , in that it is not directly linked to the picture \\' s content but to rumours and heresy . there \\' s a famous anecdote about fletch director michael ritchie inviting picketers of the last temptation of christ into a screening on his dime , just so they could know for certain what they were rallying against .

( i felt sentimental about a religion i don \\' t belong to . now that \\' s powerful filmmaking . ) smith is nothing if not sincere about his own devotion to god , and that spirituality shines through . it \\' s enough to make me forgive dogma for its editorial sins . my religion is movies . when the catholic league beats on dogma for imaginary crimes against a doctrine , in a roundabout way they \\' re attacking what i live for : freedom of expression through celluloid . i therefore feel that , although i \\' m no bible - thumper , i \\' m at least as qualified to criticize dogma as william donohue and his followers .',\n",

       " (\"big courtroom thrillers have always captivated america . o . j . simpson , tom capano , the menendez brothers . all these names are synonymous to americans and courtrooms . and , of course , courtroom dramas are not a new topic to hollywood . whether it be john grisham ' s thrilling novels or television ' s famous dramas , the courtroom has always provided big bucks . so when i rented a civil action , i was expecting the film to be like the rainmaker , a brilliant law film that kept viewers on the edge of their seat . however , what i saw in a civil action was far different from what i expected , a major surprise , but fortunately , a pleasant one . john travolta always seems to come up big when you least expect it . no one expected him to light up the screen in grease , nor in saturday night fever . but , whenever he gets knocked down , he always seems to come back fighting . a civil action is not john ' s best performance , but a strong one that could rival any performance in 1998 . travolta proves that a normal and believable performance can vault a film into oscar nominations . his performance is not flashy , nor memorable , just solid . if he delivered the only solid performance , this film would still be average . luckily , he has a strong supporting cast . william h . macy is probably one of the most underrated actors in hollywood . he continues to deliver great performances one after the other , but he is still regarded as a secondary actor . in a civil action , he delivers yet another great performance as travolta ' s paranoid and greedy accountant . he is not a lovable character , but a character who stands out in your mind whenever you think of the film . he is not one of the big time lawyers , just a measly accountant . but , he delivers one of the best supporting roles of 1998 , but there is actually someone better in a civil action . robert duvall is also an underrated actor . he gets many leading roles , but is never heard when you hear of big box office draws like tom hanks , brad pitt and jim carrey . duvall has a supporting role in this as a lawyer of the co - defendant . duvall is magical in this role . he is the wise teacher , who not only battles it out in the courtroom , but also manages to teach every major player a lesson , in his own twisted way . in many non - comedic films , directors are always trying to find a way to implement a touch of comedy , to keep the audience on their toes . unfortunately , they usually just key in on one character whose main objective is to be funny ( jar - jar binks , anyone ? ) . however , this usually backfires because the character is never fully developed . this is not the case in a civil action . they have comedy coming from all sides . whether it be duvall ' s inane questions or macy ' s sharp anger , the laughs come in a steady pace . granted , it ' s not roll in the aisle funny , but it provides a nice addition to the film . the plot is terrific - somewhat . the setup is nice with the film actually starting with a victory in the courtroom . then the case that will make or break jan ( travolta ) ' s career rears its ugly head . they find out the goldmine involved with the case and wind up taking it . however , budgets soon flounder and jan finds himself in deep debt . i will not spoil the rest , although i must speak of the one downside to the film . the courtroom debates are great , but the actual problem they are fighting for is never fully explored . it left me somewhat confused , although the rest of the film is terrific . all in all , john travolta is back yet again in this great film . his supporting cast , consisting of macy and duvall , turn in tremendous performances , which ease the load on travolta . the film is smart , witty and thought provoking . not only does it gauge in - court battles , but also the various tolls it can take on the major players . a civil action provides everything a drama lover craves .\",\n",

       " ('i actually am a fan of the original 1961 or so live - action - disney flick of the same name starring hayley mills twice as a pair of twins , separated at birth by divorcing parents , never to come in contact with the other so the parents never have to meet again . and everyone should know how i feel about remakes , especially of films i happen to enjoy ( my fallacy : unless you \\' re going to either capture the same exact spirit of the original or do something different with it or maybe even both , just wrack your brain and come up with a * gasp * new idea ) . this remake was not originally on the top of my viewing list , and was actually quite the opposite . contemporary live - action - disney films are not one of my favorties , anyway : they \\' re usually unfunny , alienating , and a big fat bore , at least to anyone over the age of 11 and above the iq of 10 . this one , however , is shockingly not bad . in fact , it \\' s actually good . not the original good , but what \\' s great about it is that it doesn \\' t necessarily retread the original or capture the same exact spirit as it does become entertaining for the same exact reasons the original was entertaining . because it \\' s cute and innocent fun . because it has a pretty killer plot that is endlessly fun to follow along with . because the lead star is immensely appealing . because the parents are also immensely appealing . and ( i \\' m repeating myself ) because it \\' s cute and innocent fun . there \\' s nothing too risque about it , save the plot ( the idea of separating twins and denying them the truth for years is ominously selfish , but that is precisely the point of the movie ) , and it \\' s aimed directly at either kids , adults who want to remember the original , or young adults who want to remember what it was like to be a kid . i , personally , am somewhere between the second and third . i can vividly remember when my taste in movies wasn \\' t so weird or diverse ( the names godard and kubrick weren \\' t even a glimmer in my right eye back then ) , when i would tune in every sunday night for a couple years to see abc \\' s \" wonderful world of disney , \" where they \\' d show you a live - action and / or made - for - tv disney flick an hour per week . i can remember my mom taking my sister and i along with all my friends and their mothers to see all the rereleased disney films ( like \" lady and the tramp \" and \" pinnochio \" ) . and , most sadly , i remember every single christmas , without fail , there were a barage of children \\' s animated half - hour shows , made exclusively for the christmas season , that i wouldn \\' t dare missing . i can even remember seeing the made - for - tv \" parent trap ii \" on tv one night , and after i had seen that one over and over and over again , i saw the original \" parent trap . \" it \\' s more of a late childhood movie , because it deals with the issue of divorce , but it deals with it in a disney - ized version . it \\' s playful , and witty , and charming , and if i saw it for the first time right now , having never experienced that part of my childhood , i \\' d probably dismiss it . i \\' d probably do the same for the new version of the same movie if i hadn \\' t seen the original at such a perfect age . watching it , i could remember what fun it was to watch a disney film , and how divorce for me started to get me thinking about the possibilities of my seemingly - perfect parents splitting up , and how it affected my adolescence . and also how it brushed that fear off with a smooth stroke , and pointed out that even in the most fucked - up of situations , things could always work out if you , well , manipulate things a bit , at least for the better . this new version did that for me , but it \\' s also charming in its own way . it has a new cast , a contemporary feel , and , for the first time in awhile for a live - action - disney flick , a tone that isn \\' t corny or condescending , but just right . the moments that would otherwise seem corny are actually affecting in a safe kind of way . and for the first time since the original film , the kids actually know better than the foolish adults . the story is basically classic by now , repeated almost as many times as kurosawa \\' s \" the seven samurai \" : a pair of twins ( played here by lindsay lohan , just like they were played by hayley mills in the original ) are separated at birth by their divorcing parents . one , annie , is sent to live with the mother ( natasha richardson , resembling her mother , vanessa redgrave , more than i had ever noticed ) in london , where she lives with her parents and her devoted , foppish butler ( simon kunz ) , as she works as a swingin \\' fashion designer . she grows up refined and classy , but also with a keen knowledge in sports and poker - playing . the other , hallie , is sent to northern california with her father ( dennis quaid ) to live on a vineyard with their pseudo - maid ( lisa ann walter ) , and grows up rugged yet charming . they both meet at the same camp , one that annie wants to go to to become more rugged . they feud because they look all - too similar , and are thus in tight competition , which results in some nasty pranks , which winds them in seclusion together in a private , out - of - the - way cabin . there , they become friends , then learn about eachother . once they know everything , they concoct a scheme to switch places so the one can meet the other parent , whom they \\' ve only heard of . they learn about eachother \\' s lives in detail , they make sure they look alike ( which requires hair cutting and , notoriously , ear - piercing - a scene which is like the kiddie version of the hypodermic needle scene in \" pulp fiction \" ) , and when the end of summer comes , they switch and hope for the best . lindsay lohan doesn \\' t necessarily copy the acting style of hayley mills in the original . but she comes off just as appealing as she did once . she does , though , add a couple new things : she makes the california twin a little more appealing and the london twin a bit more frank and snobbish than the snotty and proper original , respectively . she also adds on an american and british accent to each one , with one faking the other accent throughout , and if you really take notice , you can see that the fake ones \\' accents aren \\' t exactly perfect . she \\' s also incredibly appealing , not merely cute , which is especially notable since this is her first feature film , and we know how notorious child actors are , especially in their first films . she makes a great protagonist , and it only helps that the supporting cast is equally appealing . dennis quaid , in fact , hasn \\' t been this likable in about a decade - his big dumb smile and near cocky attitude is what has made him a notable actor in the past , not just that he \\' s mr . meg ryan . ditto natasha richardson ( except that she just hasn \\' t ever been this likable period ) . the two make a winning couple , maybe not so winning as maureen o \\' hara and the late brian keith in the original , but they still work for this film . instead of the bickering that ensued in the original , the film adds another dimension and another angle to their characters that was amiss in the original : during the opening credits , we see glimpses from their courtship on the qe2 , where they fall quickly and madly in love with eachother , and when back together again , the film \\' s more smarmy scenes come off as actually sentimental , but in that great way , not the migraine - inducing way as in many such films . this all brings this new \" parent trap \" to a level of entertainment that hasn \\' t really existed since , well , the original film years ago , still my money the best live - action - disney flick of all time . this is because it has a form of intelligence and wit that makes such plot points as an otherwise standard villainous love interest subplot ( a gold - digging sharon stone type , played by elaine hendrix , who \\' s deliciously tormented by the twins later on in the film ) a treat instead of a bore . like the original , this film transcends all the crap that it very well could be ( case in point : \" it takes two \" starring the olsen twins ) because it treats the children as the smart ones , and the adults as the silly ones , not the other way around . and because , above everything , it knows exactly how to be charming without biting off more than it can chew . however , in comparison with the original , it could be a bit better . certain scenes work well , but not nearly as well as they worked in the original . i liked the way the parents fought over past dilemnas and then fought over falling in love again better than i liked watching two old flames getting back together over a bottle of wine - somehow , feuding is always more cinematic and pleasing than mere reminscing , a lesson extracted from the howard hawks / cary grant films of yesteryear . and as much as this film transcends mere cutedom , compared to the original , this film almost drowns in cutedom . the original , though not gritty , was far more stylized and just as suitable for adult audiences as it was for young audiences . as such , this remake may never be nearly as great or classic as the original film , but it at least knows how to treat its source material with dignity and respect , and how to create virtually the same effects without bordering on plagerism or petty annoyances .',\n",

       " (\"note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . be forewarned . at the end of the day , those reflecting upon the debacle that is the avengers would do well to take note that warning clouds loomed on the horizon for the project well before warner bros . made the contentious decision to abandon preview press screenings and scrapped plans for a gala premiere . this highly - anticipated film rendition of the cult television show was originally slotted for an early june opening , where it would have gone head - to - head against the rival studios ' heavy hitters ; its eventual demotion to a less potent mid - august opening was an obvious early indication of the studio ' s lack of confidence with the picture . and with good reason . this is a joyless exercise of a film , held together by a barely coherent plot and lacking any semblance of excitement , thrills or wit . remarkable in its banality and brutally uninvolving , the avengers is a catastrophic mess which immediately invites comparisons to last year ' s case study in style over substance , joel schumacher ' s much - loathed batman & robin . ( indeed , both films even feature appalling , ridiculous sequences which find central characters dressed up in fuzzy oversized costumes . ) uma thurman , who takes on the salacious role of the catsuit - clad , karate - chopping emma peel immortalized by diana rigg , was the only bright spot in the aforementioned schumacher disaster , imbuing her poison ivy with a dose of sassiness and sly wit that gave audiences something to smile at amidst the cinematic carnage . unfortunately , the same can ' t be said here , where she and cohort ralph fiennes ( our new john steed , taking over for patrick macnee ) demonstrate no appreciable chemistry whatsoever , fatally crippling the picture as they volley fizzling repartee back and forth and trade double - entendres with all the enthusiasm of two actors painfully aware that they ' re on board a sinking ship . at this rate , usually - splendid actor mr . fiennes may never make the transition from arthouse apollo to mainstream leading man -- his tepid turn here will make as much of an inroad as his commendably seedy performance in the regrettably - neglected kathyrn bigelow film strange days . the duo * look * the part -- and admittedly the avengers is , more than most , heavily dependent upon style -- but they ' re no fun to watch , and i found myself growing increasingly distant and annoyed by the lack of spark between the two cheekily ironic characters as they navigated through the picture ' s caper - esque plot . when not checking my wristwatch or shifting restlessly in my seat , i began to alleviate the boredom by considering how this all might have played out had the filmmakers chose to go instead with that erstwhile emma as our mrs . peel -- no , not kate beckinsale ( although the notion now intrigues me ) , but gwyneth paltrow , who was originally in the running for the part and can veritably handle a spot - on english accent . if nothing else , it ' d at least be highly entertaining for the incongruous sight of the vaguely twiggish young actress kicking butt . the story , such as it is , involves the ever - bemused tandem of steed and peel combating the malevolent sir august de wynter ( sean connery ) , an eccentric aristocrat threatening the safety of the nation with his climate - controlling contraption . ( they also sip a lot of tea . ) overlooking some goofy cloning nonsense and quirky hijinx involving our protagonists ' superiors , it sounds far better than it plays , and is rendered almost indecipherable by blatant post - production tinkering ; it ' s clearly evident that the picture has been cut to shreds . the avengers was never about gripping drama , and our heroes accordingly never take villainous sir august very seriously , but given the lack of cohesion in the plot and the lack of menace conveyed by the buffoonish maniac , it ' s all decidedly uncompelling . mr . connery , who ' s onscreen barely long enough to register an impression , approaches the role like a man fulfilling a contractual obligation , simultaneously chewing the scenery while unable to hide his disinterest . at least it all looks good . this is a genuinely handsome production , with fine costume design by anthony powell and crisply shot by roger pratt . in particular , the gleaming production design by stuart craig commands attention , adeptly drawing elements both old and new in order to depict this great britain . there are a handful of striking visual moments in the film , including an attack by a swarm of giant robotic bees and a nice shot of steed and peel finding a way to walk on water , but the film is so unremittingly dull that even these instances fail to stir interest or raise pulse rates . by the time the film ' s climax had arrived , my interest was not with the sight of steed and sir august slugging it out amidst crashing waves and thundering rain , but with the quickest escape route from the theatre . not coincidentally , the enticing bits of visual bravura were the shots assembled into the movie ' s remarkable trailer , a savvy piece of work which ironically is infinitely more appealing that the feature film itself ; the first promo which made the rounds in early spring is probably my favourite studio trailer so far this year . it ' s everything that the avengers is not -- saucy , clever , engaging , and entertaining . a crushing disappointment , the film is one of the worst outings of the year -- too drearily awful to be savoured as gleefully bad , too polished to overlook its deficiencies . there may be upcoming pictures that are even more lifeless than the avengers , but i sure hope not .\",\n",

( fat bastard ) all three characters are different , and mike myers does do a good job handling each one of them . heather graham made a great addition with her talent to tswsm , and does a much better job than elizabeth hurley did , who gave a very flat performance in the original , speaking her lines without any feeling or emotion . speaking of hurley , she can be seen in tswsm for a few brief moments . hopefully , graham tags along for future austin powers adventures . the bottom line - a groovy sequel that mike myers put all of his mojo into writing .',\n",

       " ('in october of 1962 the united states found itself on the brink of nuclear holocaust when u2 spy plane fly - overs of cuba revealed that the soviet union was actively deploying and installing medium range ballistic missiles 90 miles from the us . president john kennedy ( bruce greenwood ) and his staff must face this major threat to world peace and stop soviet expansionism in director roger donaldson \\' s dramatic recreation of the most dangerous crisis in american history in \" thirteen days . \" one of the highlights to come out of made - for - tv movies was a 1974 entry called \" missiles of october \" that also recreated the historic event that almost embroiled the us , ussr and the world in an all out nuclear showdown . that teleplay , starring william devane and martin sheen as john and bobby , showed the political tensions of the period that brought to the fore the danger the world faced in those two weeks in 1962 . now , a quarter of a century after the landmark tv movie , director roger donaldson and producer kevin costner team together again ( the last time was for the taught spy thriller \" no way out \" ) to re - enact the events of that most dangerous time in america \\' s and the world \\' s history . taken from the viewpoint of special assistant to the president kenneth p . o \\' donnell ( costner ) , donaldson and crew recreate that volatile event , once again , as the country is plunged into what could have been total nuclear war . as o \\' donnell gets ready to head to work one october morning , he deals with the usual family crises and problems . meanwhile , a u2 spy plane photo mission over cuba has produced some startling images - medium range nuclear missiles in the first stage of deployment . suddenly , ken \\' s routine day switches into crisis mode as the president and his key advisor bobby begin to muster the considerable forces of the us military to face the soviet threat . where \" thirteen days \" differs most from \" missiles of october \" is , as expected , in the scope of the project . there is a big difference , budget - wise , between making a television docudrama and one that goes to the big screen . it shows as the makers of \" thirteen days \" craft a recreation of the cuban missile crisis that encompasses not only the political intrigue within the white house , it also depicts the events that took place as america girds itself for nuclear confrontation . the cast , a true ensemble , is led , surprisingly , by bruce greenwood as jfk and not by kevin costner . costner \\' s o \\' donnell represents the family guy thing as the drama of the crisis has its impact on him and his family . this puts a personal spin on the film as we see both the crisis and america \\' s preparation for war and the pressure it brings to bear on those in the know . kenny reassures his wife and kids that all will be okay and they will be safe , but he knows that , if the crisis comes to a head , his family will be no more . the meat of \" thirteen days \" is in the big picture , not the microcosm of family , though . this is where the film stands out as we see the workings of our government on the highest levels . the story does not just cover the face - off between the world \\' s two most powerful countries ; it also depicts the animosity between the president and the military / cia . the disaster of the bay of pigs invasion the year before left a distrustful taste in the mouths of the generals and admirals who blame the kennedys for not backing the cuban expatriates fighting fidel castro . the missile crisis becomes a struggle for power as the army / navy / air force want to flex their might and invade cuba , while jfk wants to end the confrontation peaceably but with america \\' s dignity and world leadership intact . while the internal battle for power rages in the white house , with air force chief curtis lemay ( kevin conway ) advising the president to bomb cuba into the stone age , our armed forces are set into motion to stop the soviets with a blockade of offensive weapons to cuba . this is where the political intrigues of high office are replaced by exciting action . when the first confrontation takes place between a us warship and a soviet freighter , the tension is palpable . the most involving action sequence takes place late in the game as another u2 is sent up to shoot some snaps of the buildup and the fully prepared soviet forces launch an anti - aircraft attack on the hapless pilot of the spy plane . this is a sweaty palm sequence to say the least , making you squirm in your seat as you try to help the pilot avoid those missiles . the ensemble cast places greenwood as the first among equals with like weight given to all the principle players . greenwood does not play act at being a caricature of jfk , foregoing the typical kennedy boston accent . instead , he plays the man as a powerful figure who has to maintain the dignity of the office , directing his subordinates but giving them the latitude to make clear all of his options . kennedy used this decision by committee method to good effect as his senior staff uncovers all the options available to the president . costner , as ken o \\' donnell , is really a supporting cast member as a kennedy crony brought on board as a personal political favor . costner plays o \\' donnell as if he crammed on old jfk speeches with a forced kennedyesque twang to his speech . the rest of the players are first rate from start to finish with steven culp looking and sounding just like robert kennedy . the rest of the familiar players in this drama are uniformly well cast , too . standing out are michael fairman as the beleaguered us ambassador to the un , adlai stevenson , who was forced to become the challenging voice of the united states in the united nations and i remember the confrontation vividly . the filmmakers capture the accusations laid down by stevenson with accuracy , using old style video footage to good effect . dylan baker has the look and feel of the intelligentsia as the brainy secretary of defense robert mcnamara . kevin conway gives his general lemay the right \" bomb them to hell \" attitude . also notable is christopher lawford as navy pilot william ecker who , with his wingman , takes on the dangerous mission of a low - level photo recon into the heart of cuba , bravely challenging kenny o \\' donnell \\' s admonition , \" don \\' get shot . \" tech credits are superb across the board with an admirable depiction of the us armed forces being placed on a war footing . it \\' s an impressive production with the careful use of period aircraft and ships that gives the film a veracity fitting the event . solid costuming by isis mussenden is subtle but has the look of the kennedys . there is the usual array of vintage cars from the period to make things look right . the special f / x of the u2 sequences are a nice crafting of computer imaging . the cuban missile crisis is probably the most intense two weeks that the united states has ever faced in its survival as a world leader . helmer donaldson and his fine crew and cast have given the depiction of this crucial event with the care and attention to details that make this one of the finest docudramas of the year . i give \" thirteen days \" an a - .',\n",

       " (\"` the skulls ' is a laughably bad thriller , a teen - orientated doppelganger of ` the firm ' so blazingly ridiculous that it caused me to drift into a hypnotic stupor . certain moments are so preposterous that i nearly herniated myself in an attempt to stifle laughter . i chuckled incessantly , all the way home . let me share . the skulls is a secret society conceived inside the walls of yale ( designed , i ' m sure , to mirror the actual skull & bones from the same college ) . luke mcnamara ( joshua jackson ) , a townie and local varsity rowing championship victor for the third consecutive year , highlights the latest skull scouting report . despite some anxiety and caution from others , luke accepts entry into the organization . soon after , he finds himself surrounded by beautiful women , driving a new car and marveling at the $ 20 , 000 that somehow surfaced in his bank account . yeah , dude , pretty good deal eh ? but luke soon learns that the membership is somewhat suffocating ; when circumstances become extreme , there is no way he can leave the society - except maybe as a drooling vegetable . the premise , although lacking in originality , certainly offers its share of potential intrigue and suspense . unfortunately , ` the skulls ' is neither intriguing , nor suspenseful , nor anything else you would associate with fresh or exciting . it ' s just another abysmal teen prototype that has the soundtrack , the stars . . . . but not the script . ` the skulls ' is so bad it attains a certain level of entertainment value , with the screenplay , by jon pogue , immediately becoming the basis for a slew of unintentional howlers . first off , upon their initiation into the skulls , each new member has to have a skull branded onto their arm . afterward they are supplied with a wristwatch that conveniently covers up the scar . will they never take this watch off ? and what if they forget it by their bedside ? perhaps their ? secret ' society was being a little too conspicuous when they decided to brand new members like cattle on an area of the body that is easily exposed . on top of this , they are each given a rulebook and a key to headquarters . gee , why not member t - shirts ? but my favorite bit is this : the voting committee for the skulls does not bother with individual ? agree ' or ? disagree ' notions when making collective decisions . they are given official skull paddles . when flipped to one side , they indicate the member agrees with the proposal . facing the opposite way means a disagreement . wouldn ' t they merely express themselves verbally ? hell no . they have to retrieve the paddles for a proper vote , and maybe afterward they can play ping - pong . i ' m still chuckling about these ludicrous details , but the humiliating dialogue is enough to send one into arrest . the cast , meanwhile , combines a pinch of veteran talent with a dash of the ` dawson ' s creek ' crowd , and fuses the two together , ensuring that the embarrassment will be a mutually shared union throughout . but not entirely . accomplished actors like craig t . nelson ( as skulls chairman judge litten mandrake ) and william peterson ( as fellow board member senator levritt ) are dealt pathetic villain caricatures , and look suitably embarrassed handling them . and then there ' s christopher mcdonald , who has the capacity to be a fun , exciting actor . mcdonald ' s charisma is totally diminished here as he sleepwalks through another perfunctory bad guy role ( yes , pogue makes it a hat - trick ) . i pray it was a ` snatch - the - paycheck - and - run ' exercise for all these actors . the young troupe of performers involved fair moderately better . let ' s cut the talented canadian lad joshua jackson some slack for maintaining believability within the confines of his character . paul walker , the strapping quarterback from ` varsity blues ' , is bland but passable as caleb mandrake - the judge ' s son . walker preserves a straight face , even when dealt the silliest dialogue in the movie ( ` dad , i just killed a guy in the ritual room ! ' ) . some actual spark is generated by leslie bibb , who plays luke ' s longtime chum chloe , and manages to successfully pull off some convincing dramatics . it really boils down to the actors attempting to puncture the surrounding plastic bubble of absurdity that cages them from minute one . or maybe not minute one , thanks to a decent set - up from director rob cohen , who films early sequences with a sense of atmosphere and style . it makes you wonder why he didn ' t flee indefinitely from the project , because while enjoyable cheese like ` dragonheart ' and the moderate stallone thriller ` daylight ' aren ' t superior cinema , they belong on the afi top 100 list when compared to this degrading trash . aside from unintentionally humoring the audience , ` the skulls ' gets little accomplished . the thrills and action are lazy and mechanical . the story is stuffed with ridiculous , formulaic plotting that sheepishly overlooks the cool potential of a secret underground society flick . instead of gaining knowledge about the skulls as an organization , we are thrust into a lame video surveillance conspiracy that has developed barnacles from excessive usage . we ' ve seen it all before , and better . ` the skulls ' is a feeble little circus of stupidity , so miscalculated that -- while it would serve as a clever pun -- a term like ? boneheaded ' seems just too generous .\",\n",

for shyamalan , the answer must have come as easy to him as nuclear physics does to kindergartners . does this new film measure up to his breakthrough box office smash , though ? the answer to that question is not a very easy one , either . as far as pacing goes , the sixth sense seemed almost interminable . it wasn \\' t until the surprise ending was revealed that i realized the film was actually intentionally ( and perfectly ) paced in order to give the audience ample time to re - connect all of the information they had seen once the climax had been reached . for unbreakable , shyamalan gave the film a much more satisfying pace which , in many ways , blows away the film that had come before . the story moves along at a steady pace and shyamalan \\' s direction is excellent , with the camera almost constantly moving . there are tons of great shots in the film , not least of which is a conversation that opens the film between willis \\' character and another train passenger . the shot seems as though it were filmed like we were watching the two talk from between the train seats and the camera steadily glides back and forth between the two actors as they speak . also very impressive is the film \\' s score by james newton howard ( who also scored shyamalan \\' s sixth sense and the similar film stir of echoes , as well as this year \\' s dinosaur ) . several of the scenes are driven by a very catchy beat and help to increase the tempo of the film . one of the best examples of this is a scene in which dunne goes into a train station to \" exercise \" his powers . the music , in combination with the stellar visuals , really go a long way towards making this an incredible movie . if there was any one soundtrack i would make a must purchase this year , this one would be it . the film also boasts some great performances , including a precocious child actor trying to vie for the oscar throne left vacant by haley joel osment . willis turns in a great performance as the sad sack dunne , who just can \\' t seem to figure out why he \\' s been depressed for the last few years . his character almost seems pathetic when we first meet him , but he eventually grows into his own under elijah \\' s tutelage . jackson is one of the better actors of our time , and here he turns in yet another great performance as the ever injured elijah . though his hairstyle is absurd , jackson seems to infuse such a great deal of pain into his role that the mortar board hairdo can easily be overlooked . robin wright penn \\' s role seems slightly underwritten , but she still manages to get across the intense hurt of her character \\' s need for love from her husband and her desire to make things work again . spencer treat clark , as the dunne \\' s young son jeremy , shows that shyamalan still has a knack for picking young actors , and he turns in one of the most competent performances in the film . out of all the characters , jeremy \\' s is perhaps the most emotional , and clark does a great job with the role . where the film does lose points though , is during its \" surprise \" ending . shyamalan has said in interviews that he was going to do an ending that blew away the one presented by the sixth sense , but i found myself saying \" that was it ? ! \" when unbreakable revealed its own ending . it \\' s not that the ending is bad , it \\' s just that the ending doesn \\' t quite have the emotional punch that the other film \\' s did . plus , it almost seems like it sets itself up for sequels ( and i won \\' t reveal the ending here , but you \\' ll understand what i mean when you see it ) . essentially , what all of this means is that shyamalan has made another good film with unbreakable . the only real problem is that the ending doesn \\' t quite fill the shadow left by its predecessor . as long as it isn \\' t held to the standard that sixth sense set ( which it ultimately will be ) , it should be a remarkably well liked film . one thing seems clear , though . shyamalan definitely has an affinity for comic books that he would like to share with the world and many comic book fans will also delight the vision he presents in this film .',\n",

not surprisingly , the most energetic performance is given by samuel l . jackson , but his harry isn \\' t a person ; he \\' s a walking plot device spouting occasionally - witty dialogue . dustin hoffman isn \\' t lively or particularly good -- it \\' s ironic that this , which may be his worst work in a decade , has arrived in theaters on the heels of his best actor nomination ( for wag the dog ) . sharon stone and peter coyote are both flat . their characters exhibit little evidence of emotion ; automatons would have been as effective . then there \\' s queen latifa , who , despite getting fifth billing in the credits ( ahead of liev schreiber , who boasts at least quadruple her screen time ) , has less than a handful of lines and almost nothing to do other than inflate the body count . i like to think that levinson and hoffman , recognizing how uninspired this movie was likely to be , chose to make wag the dog as a sort of penance ( the low - budget picture was filmed during sphere \\' s lengthy pre - production phase ) . if that \\' s the case , forgiveness is granted . i \\' m less inclined to look favorably upon crichton , although he has a few enjoyable titles on his resume ( jurassic park and the levinson - directed disclosure come to mind ) . even if his novel was butchered in the adaptation process , crichton \\' s credit as a producer disallows him absolution . he was a willing participant in a creative travesty . no wonder sphere is being released in february , in the midst of the early year \\' s cinematic wasteland . it deserves no better than to get sunk by the unstoppable titanic , which should plow sphere under on its way to a ninth - consecutive weekend atop the box office heap .',\n",

       " (\"did claus von bulow try to kill his wife sunny in their newport mansion ? that is the question reversal of fortune asks you to consider as it opens in a hospital ward , with a comatose sunny von bulow . she is the main narrator of the film , in a narrative trick that was extraordinarily risky for schroeder . the dramatic trick works , as sunny von bulow narrates a compelling story of murder , sex , unhappiness , and a lawyer ' s moral dilemma as he takes a case he thinks he cannot win . jeremy irons is claus von bulow , in what is his finest role , and one of the most devastingly evil performances in history . he is as hated as any man alive , as cold as a cucumber . his remorse for his wife ' s comatose condition is nonexistant , and it is no wonder that even his children have difficulty accepting his version of what happened during christmas , 1980 . the background to the case is such . during christmas of 1979 , sunny von bulow fell into a deep coma from which she recovered and awoke . the same situation occured in 1980 , only sunny never woke , and probably never will . when examined , it was found that she had 14 times the normal amount of insulin within her blood . claus von bulow is then accused of attempted murder by his stepson , convicted , and freed on bail . he immediately hires alan dershowitz , the renowed harvard law professor , to acquit him . ron silver is magnificent as a moral lawyer who cannot stand what has happened to him . we follow him through two very different cases ; the case of the johnson case , where two innocent kids are standing on death row for a crime they didn ' t commit , and von bulow , who he still hasn ' t figured out . dershowitz doesn ' t know what happened to sunny , and he is extremely hesitant to take the case . nevertheless , he does , based on certain things which happen during the investigative process that deeply upset him . together with a group of law students , dershowitz concocts a defense and ultimately get the verdict reversed . silver ' s performance is one of a handful of solid roles in this deep film . schroeder directs on many different levels , with multiple plot lines which blend in wonderfully in the mind of alan dershowitz . there are flaws ; at times , the film gets overly theatrical . yet , due to glenn close ' s troubled and brutally honest performance as sunny von bulow , the use of her comatose body as a narrator works here fairly well . the flashbacks are good , but at times schroeder doesn ' t fill in the blanks . the movie could have benefited with the increased attention of certain developments during the film , and it could have used a better ending . the film progressed wonderfully before ending suddenly , without any intelligent conclusion . the supporting characters are often neglected , and dershowitz ' s team should have been allowed to grow character wise , but schroeder over - simplifies the story and the characters . yet , for all these flaws , the film is deeply engrossing because of irons . as von bulow , he is brutally evil . anti - semitic , prejudiced , arrogant , protective , he is a rotten , lying monster , whose conviction may have been wrong legally , but morally he was to blame . irons plays him to a cold perfection , with pathetic attempts to gain moral support for his claims to innocence . he is an adulterous liar and a cheat who in all likelihood committed the murder . however , the genius of reversal of fortune comes in its distinction between moral culpability and legal responsibility . there is no doubt von bulow is responsible for his wife ' s death by years of neglect and coldness . however , legally , did he do the murder ? schroeder dares the viewer to make up his own mind . with all the character flaws , reversal of fortune is an engrossing puzzle because it is intelligent ; he wants the viewer to make up his own mind . schroeder taunts the viewer with contradictory revelations , and then mentions that the answer to this compelling puzzle shall be revealed when we join sunny von bulow , in death . for all the failed dramatic theatrics , this is one that works beautifully . we don ' t know what happened . that sense of legal ambiguousness , along with von bulow ' s obvious moral guilt , is why reversalf fortune works . in the end , von bulow is as sadistic as ever . irons is haunting , and that is why reversal of fortune is so good .\",\n",

       " ('this sunday afternoon i had the priviledge of attending a private screening at the sony astor cinema in new york city , of james cameron \\' s most heralded film , titanic . postponed from last summer , with an escalated budget that makes it the most expensive movie in history , this was one film i was eager to preview . so , is this movie going to sink or swim this holiday ? my best guess . . . . it will sink , though with many awards attatched to its hull . no doubt , titanic is the most elaborate disaster movie ever made . it boasts the most amazing effects that i have ever seen done to date . to see a ship fall apart , with actual people running across the ship , flying across the deck , and falling to the water , is just amazing to look at . the effects are so stunningly realistic , you would swear you were looking at actual footage . but titanic is more than a disaster movie , and that \\' s where the problem lies . there is a love story attatched that nearly ruins the entire premise . i \\' ll give a capsule summary of the story without spoiling anything for you : the film begins with a modern day excavation of sorts of the sunken titanic . we see actual footage of the sunken ship , as cammeron had set up special cameras to film the wreckage on the ocean floor . bill paxton leads the expedition , in search of sunken treasure . what he finds instead , leads him to a mysterious old woman who recounts her tale of the titanic voyage . we meet rose ( kate winslet ) , a young woman , who comes from an upper - class family . rose is to be wed to a man she does not love . we meet jack ( leonardo dicaprio ) , a young man , who comes from a poor financial background , and wins a ticket aboard the titanic , in a poker game . the two meet under interesting circumstances , and the love story begins . add in a jealous fiance , and a not - so - nice law officer played by david warner , and you have a story that , well , gets a bit overplayed and oversappy . i must add , at this point , that the most likeable character in the movie is played by kathy bates , as a woman with \" new money \" who is a lot less uptight than the other rich folk on the ship . she is a pleasure to see on screen . when the ship does hit the iceberg at exactly 1 : 40 into the film , and eventually sinks , you never really feel for any of these characters . the film is just loaded with unlikeable rich snobs and other folk you never really get a grasp on . the effects are tremendous . from the roars of gears and pumps in the engine room , to a doomed ship cracking at the seams , this is an effects picture that looks and sounds like no other . we saw titanic in dolby digital surround , and by far , it is the best sounding movie i have ever seen . my friend commented it was the best sound mix he has ever heard . when people are in the water , at film \\' s end , you are surrounded by the voices of lost soles . titanic runs far too long . the movie is 3 hours and 15 minutes in length . and , while most of the first 2 . 5 hours runs very fast and well - paced , the final 45 minutes almost comes to a sudden stop , and you realize that this sappy love story has to finish itself out before the movie finally ends . don \\' t get me wrong about titanic . . . . it \\' s not a bad as i am making it out to be . it really is an exceptionaly well - made film . the costumes and sets are incredible , and true to the time period . the ship is painstakingly created exactly true to form , as we see actual pictures of the modern - day wreckage , transformed into the movie depiction . this film will certainly win on effects , costume , set design and sound . cameron has certainly made his best film to date . unfortunately , titanic is not a best picture candidate . it just doesn \\' t have a strong supporting story . it \\' s an exceptional disaster film with sappy filler inside . it just doesn \\' t have the emotional impact that i suspect mr . cameron was shooting for . i predict that titanic will open to likeable reviews . it is a film worth seeing . i predict that it will only do moderately well at the box office . with its extreme running time , and lack of enough robust to get substantial word - of - mouth , i expect that it will do even better on home video . this will certainly be the definitive ac3 movie for all you home theater enthusiasts . titanic opens december 19th , and is released by paramount pictures and twentieth century - fox . i give titanic 3 stars ( . that \\' s not bad . ron epstein riginally posted in home theater forum ===',\n",

       " (\"in the opening shot of midnight cowboy , we see a close - up of a blank movie screen at a drive - in . we hear in the soundtrack human cries and the stomping of horses ' hooves . without an image projected onto the screen , the audience unerringly identifies the familiar sound of cowboys chasing indians and can spontaneously fill in the blank screen with images of old westerns in our mind ' s eye . even without having seen a cowboys and indians movie , somehow the cliched images of them seem to have found their way into our mental schema . but do cowboys really exist , or are they merely hollywood images personified by john wayne and gary cooper ? exploring this theme , director john schlesinger uses the idea of the cowboy as a metaphor for the american dream , an equally cliched yet ambiguous concept . is the ease at which salvation and success can be attained in america a hallmark of its experience or an urban legend ? midnight cowboy suggests that the american dream , like image of the cowboy , is merely a myth . as joe buck migrates from place to place , he finds neither redemption nor reward in his attempt to create a life for himself , only further degeneration . during the opening credits , joe walks past an abandoned theater whose decrepit marquee reads ` john wayne : the alamo . ' as joe is on the bus listening to a radio talk show , a lady on the air describes her ideal man as ` gary cooper ? but he ' s dead . ' a troubled expression comes across joe ' s face , as he wonders where have all the cowboys gone . having adopted the image of a cowboy since youth , joe now finds himself deserted by the persona he tried to embody . joe ' s persistence in playing the act of the cowboy serves as an analogue to his american dream . he romanticizes about making it in the big city , but his dreams will desert him as he is forced to compromise his ideals for sustenance . by the end of midnight cowboy , joe buck loses everything and gains nothing . just as the audience can picture cowboys chasing indians on a blank screen , we can also conjure up scenes from pretty woman as paradigms of american redemption and success . but how realistic are these ideals ? joe had raped and been raped in texas . the scars of his troubled past prompt him to migrate to new york , but he does not know that his aspirations to be a cowboy hero will fail him there just as they had in texas . alongside the dream of success is the dream of salvation . the ability to pack up one ' s belongings and start anew seems to be an exclusive american convention . schlesinger provides us with strong hints as to joe ' s abusive and abused past with flashbacks of improper relationships with crazy anne and granny . we understand that joe adopts the fa ? ade of a cowboy , a symbol of virility and gallantry , as an attempt to neutralize his shame . he runs from his past only to be sexually defiled this time by his homosexual experiences in new york . in the scene at the diner which foreshadows joe ' s encounter with the gay student , joe buck spills ketchup on himself . standing up , we see the ketchup has made a red stain running from the crotch of his pants down his thigh . schlesinger visually depicts the degeneration of joe ' s virility by eliciting an image of bleeding genitals , signifying emasculation . beyond the symbol of castration , the scene may also connote the bleeding of a virgin ' s first sexual encounter , a reference to joe ' s first homosexual liaison . the fact that the idea of a bleeding virgin is relegated only to females furthers the imagery of joe ' s emasculation . it is ironic that joe has trouble prospecting for female clients , but effortlessly attracts men . joe believes his broncobuster getup is emblematic of his masculinity ; new yorkers see his ensemble as camp and ` faggot stuff . ' there are two predominant images of new york . the first is that new york is the rich , cosmopolitan city where hope and opportunity are symbolized by the tall skyscrapers and the statue of liberty . the other new york is travis bickle ' s new york , a seedy , corruptive hell on earth . joe envisions new york as the former , but is presented with the latter . mirroring the irony in which joe envisions his cowboy attire as masculine , he mistakenly buys into the fable that new york is filled with lonely women neglected by gay men . joe thinks he is performing a great service for new york , but the city rapes him of his pride and possessions . the people steal joe ' s money , the landlord confiscates his luggage , and the homosexuals rob him of his dignity . what has become of joe ' s american dream ? schlesinger responds to this question with the scene at the party . joe gets invited to a shindig of sorts and at the gathering is exposed to a dizzying array of food , drugs , and sex . at the party , all of joe and ratzo ' s desires are made flesh ; joe flirts successfully with women and ratzo loads up on free salami . contrasting joe ' s daily struggles , shots of warhol ' s crew display wanton indulgence . there is an irreverence in the partygoers ' attitude ; we see a shot of a woman kowtowing to nothing in particular , orgies breaking out in the periphery , and drugs passed around like party favors . the party makes a mockery of joe ' s ideals . joe believed that hard work and persistence were the elements for success in america ; scenes of the party and his rendezvous with shirley suggest that it is the idle who profit from joe ' s toils . the american dream , schlesinger suggests , is merely a proletarian fantasy , for those who are content no longer dream , but become indolent . as joe heads to miami , all that was significant of the cowboy image has left him . his masculinity is compromised and his morality is relinquished . for joe , nothing is left of the cowboy hero and commensurately , he surrenders the identity . tossing his boots into the garbage , he returns to the bus for the last leg of his journey to miami . the final shot of midnight cowboy shows joe inside the bus , more introspective , taking only a few glances outside the window . instead of the frequent pov shots of joe excitedly looking out of the bus on his way to new york , schlesinger sets up this final shot from the exterior of the bus looking in through the window at joe . reflections of the palm trees ratzo so raved about run across the bus ' window with joe hardly taking notice . the scenery of miami no longer exacts the same excitement from joe as before . the world seems smaller to joe now ; the termination of his journey coincides with the termination of his american dream . no longer does joe aspire to be the enterprising gigolo ; he resolves to return to a normal job and resign to basic means . midnight cowboy presents two familiar incarnations of the american dream . there is the frontier fantasy that if you are brave enough to repel a few indians , you can set up a ranch out west and raise a beautiful family . then there is the jay gatsby dream that a man of humble stock , with perseverance , can make a fortune in the big city . joe ' s attempt to realize these dreams robs him of his innocence in texas and morality in new york . during his search for an intangible paradise , joe ends up raping a girl and killing a man . an allegory of chasing the promise of the american dream , joe buck ' s progressive moral atrophy is a warning against the pursuit of illusory icons .\",\n",

       " ('when casting the key part of the voice of moses , most people \\' s first candidate would probably not be the controversial actor val kilmer ( the saint and the island of dr . moreau ) , but he was dreamworks \\' s choice in their first traditionally animated movie , the prince of egypt . the selection of kilmer proved to be a wise one , but the biggest risk dreamworks took wasn \\' t in the casting department . the radical departure was that they decided to use the medium of animation to make a biblical epic , a la cecil b . demille , to move our hearts and minds rather than to tickle our funny bones . in the press kit producer penney cox says that they wanted to make a film for adults based on sophisticated themes but one that did not exclude children . animated movies for adults that are appropriate for kids and that are not comedies , now that is something fresh . let me admit up - front that i was quite skeptical as to whether dreamworks could pull it off . dreamworks \\' s antz seemed to be a movie not quite appropriate for any age group . the prince of egypt may be harder to market than antz , but it is much more satisfying . like antz and unlike the more modest casting of pixar \\' s a bug \\' s life , the prince of egpyt has half of hollywood doing the voices . danny glover is the voice of jethro , jeff goldblum of aaron , steve martin of hotep , helen mirren of the queen , michelle pfeiffer of tzipporah , martin short of huy and patrick stewart of seti . you can figure out for yourself who does the voice of god . the movie , which is weakest in the story department , is a cliff \\' s notes version of demille \\' s the ten commandments . the script by kelly asbury and lorna cook has an obsession with touching briefly on every classic event in moses \\' s life . demille took over three and a half hours in order to do it justice . at less than half of that , the prince of egypt rushes through so much material that it doesn \\' t establish sufficient depth for us to bond with the characters . we meet moses when the queen finds him floating in his little basket . we watch him grow up and become best bud and a chariot racing partner to ramses ( ralph fiennes ) , the future pharaoh . moses is a free spirit and a practical joker until he finds out his true identity as a jew . ( \" all i \\' ve ever known to be true is a lie , \" moses complains . ) after finding out his real identity , he sees for the first time the oppression of the jewish slaves that are all around him . after leaving egypt , moses comes back to ask ramses to let moses \\' s people go . this leads to the classic scene of the parting of the red sea , which is one of many places where computers were used to enhance the traditionally hand - drawn animation of the most of the production . it is the absolutely stunning visuals that make the movie so compelling . drawn with a rich palette of luxurious roses , blues and golds , the picture looks sumptuous from its first frame to its last . the construction of the temple is shown in blowing dust , and other scenes are shot with the glow of a rising sun . the most original visual sequence in the film occurs during a dream moses has . done with an explicit two - dimensional look , the colorful images painted on the temple walls come to life to tell their own animated story . even though it has its weaknesses , the prince of egypt is a noble attempt to carve out a new genre -- serious animated movies for adults that are acceptable for the entire family . this awe - inspiring movie deserves to be seen . the prince of egypt runs about 1 : 30 . it is rated pg for thematic elements and would be fine for the whole family . how old a kid would need to be to be interested depends on the child , but those over 8 will probably like it .',\n",

       " ('after watching the first ten minutes of this japanese film , you will never eat a bowl of ramen the same way again . there is a scene where an old man is teaching a young one how to eat the soupy bowl of noodles , as a master would teach an eager apprentice . \" you caress the noodles with the chopsticks , \" he says , \" then put the roast pork on the side of the bowl and apologize to it by saying , \\' see you soon . \\' \" of course , it \\' s meant to be a parody , but there is an earnestness underneath the silliness that makes you take it with a certain degree of sobriety . you begin to appreciate the food as not merely something you eat , not something you like , not something you enjoy , but rather something you experience . experiencing it is a process which engages all of the senses , fulfilling each one on its own terms and weaving them so that the total is a pleasure that is more than the sum of its parts . trust me , you really want to go find a noodle shop at this point . juzo itami \\' s tampopo brings the same sense of the serious parody of food to the forefront by making the story follow the pattern of an american western , set in modern day japan . a stranger , goro ( tsutomu yamazaki ) , comes into town and finds tampopo ( nobuko miyamoto ) , the proprietor of a small , hole - in - the - wall noodle shop , trying to fend off the insults of the local strongman , pisken ( rikiya yasuoka ) . goro , to defend the honor of this woman and her noodles , gets into a fight with the ringleader and his henchmen , emerging bloodied , but victorious . goro finds that tampopo \\' s ambition is to have a shop that people would flock to from far away , just to eat a bowl of her ramen . the problem is , her fare is something less than popular , and less than appetizing . however , goro agrees to help tampopo in her quest , and in the process they seek the wisdom of an elderly noodle expert , enlist the aid of a wealthy patron , and make friends with the former enemy . this film is filled with many little scenes which are absolute gems . take , for example , when tampopo tries to buy the recipe for a delicious soup from another shop owner . the price is too high , but the owner of the store next door will secretly sell it to her for a more affordable sum . tampopo meets him at his store late at night , and he leads her to a back room . she protests , thinking that perhaps this man has ulterior motives , but he insists . just when she is about to bolt for the exit , he shows her a small gap in the wall adjoining his store with the noodle shop next door . she peers through and takes notes as she watches the cook make the soup for the next day , her face filled with a joy that can be felt by the audience . this scene , while comical , is very effective at filling the viewer with a sense of trepidation , then of relief and discovery . there \\' s also an interesting scene where goro introduces tampopo and her son to a bunch of street people who , despite their economic trappings , are all gourmets and master sommeliers . we even watch as one of them sneaks into the kitchen of a restaurant and expertly prepares a french omelet . the scene is meant to bring a laugh , but it also says that no matter whether people are rich or poor , food is something which everyone has in common , and the enjoyment of food is an experience shared by all . there are also a number of unrelated vignettes appearing throughout the film , which help to illustrate and accentuate the role of food in people \\' s lives . a particularly effective one involves a wife and mother being tended to in her home by a doctor . surrounded by her children , she is obviously in her last hours of life . her husband comes home , and seeing her worsened condition , demands that she get up and make dinner . the viewer knows the husband \\' s intention is not to be mean ; he is desperate for the normalcy of which he and his family has obviously been deprived , and the wife making dinner is an essential part of this . in a near miracle , the wife drags herself to the kitchen and prepares a quick meal , then brings it to her awaiting family . as the family eats , she looks on them and smiles . preparing food for her family is a joy and a comfort to her , and for a brief moment , she too enjoys the normalcy . then she falls over , dead . for a moment , the family is stunned , but then the father yells at the children , \" keep eating ! this is the last meal your mother ever made ! \" crying as they do so , the family finishes the meal . the scene is comical , awkward , moving , and beautiful . by including the vignettes , itami ran the risk of creating a disjointed film , but surprisingly , they do not interrupt the pacing of the main storyline . instead , they even help contribute to the idea that tampopo \\' s goal of being able to serve exceptional food is worthy and even noble . because the film parodies a western , the construction of the plot is fairly predictable , but is still enjoyable as we watch the familiar way in which the \" good guys \" come together for the final showdown . in this case , the showdown is against the ramen . if they eat tampopo \\' s ramen , soup and all , tampopo knows she has succeeded . it \\' s pretty obvious what the outcome will be , but when a film changes your whole perspective on something you consume every day of your life , you can afford to cut it a little slack .',\n",

( after seeing the movie , if i was devito , i probably would have wished they had pulled someone in off the street . ) emma thompson is wasted here as well . while thompson is best known for her jane austin adaptations , she is also a fine comedian . too bad she didn ' t get to use any of that talent here . am i being too hard on this film ? i don ' t think so . schwarzenegger and devito are two of my favorite actors in film today , and ivan reitman is one of the more talented directors in hollywood . with a supporting cast of emma thompson and frank langella , the filmmakers really have to be trying hard to make a bad film . they certainly managed here . maybe it was well intentioned , but unfortunately this is a movie that never should have been made . if you are tempted to see this film , do yourself a favor and go rent twins , a film that truly takes advantage of arnold schwarzenegger and danny devito ' s comedic talents .\",\n",

( note that the film has no connection with the 1975 exorcist - rip off behind the door , but for some unexplained reason was given this related title for release in the usa and australia . ) this story focuses on dora , a women set upon by a malevolent spirit that channels itself through her young son marco . the film opens with dora , her son and second husband bruno returning to a house by the sea that was the scene of her first husband ' s suicide and her subsequent trauma 7 years earlier . they hope to put the past behind them , but as small accidents start to befall dora - usually while bruno is away on business - she starts to suspect that marco ( played with uncanny ability by 8 year old david colin jr . ) is somehow involved in the strange goings on . to reveal any more of the story would be unfair . suffice to say that this artfully paced study of a woman suffering a nervous breakdown offers an intriguing plot , loads of atmosphere and solid acting , though the dialogue is somewhat weakened by the dubbing into english . bava coaches a surprisingly good performance from the usually wooden daria nicolodi , wife of famed italian horror director dario argento . her character is invested with sufficient depth to allow the audience real empathy with dora ' s troubled soul . the music by italian ensemble libra is also effective , mixing odd - sounding 70 ' s rock with classic gothic piano sequences . and there is at least one moment - brilliantly engineered by bava - that is guaranteed to lift you ten feet out of your chair . yet for italian horror , the bloodletting here is surprisingly minimal . lamberto bava and francesco barbieri ' s script is more concerned with deeper , psychological terrors , with themes of guilt and suffering , with the notion that what we sow will shall - somewhere , somehow - eventually reap . scholars of the genre take note : beyond the door ii is stylish , chilling , and essential .\",\n",

s . along the way writer / director darren stein forgets to give the film a life of its own . the film opens with a voice over from geeky fern mayo ( judy greer ) about the four most popular girls at reagan high : courtney shayne ( rose mcgowan ) who can basically be summed up as satan in heels , julie freeman ( rebecca gayheart ) a good girl with the face of a supermodel , marcie fox ( julie benz ) a dim - witted blonde who demands that people call her \" foxy \" , and liz purr ( charlotte roldan ) an angel in disguise . liz is everyone \\' s favorite because she \\' s both beautiful and kind . liz is about to turn 17 and , as a prank , courtney convinces the other girls to help her in kidnapping liz on her birthday morning . in order to keep liz from making any noise courtney stuffs a jawbreaker into her mouth before they gag her . they then stuff liz in the trunk of courtney \\' s car but when they open it later , polaroid camera waiting to capture the moment , their lives will never be the same : poor liz has swallowed the jawbreaker and choked to death with it lodged in her throat ( the audience is treated to a few too many graphic looks at liz \\' s dead body ) . courtney , thinking fast , decides to pass the death off as a rape / murder and marcie and a reluctant julie assist her . things get complicated when fern discovers what the three girls are up to . in order to keep her quiet courtney comes up with another plan and transforms geeky fern into \" vylette \" , hoping that she will also help to replace liz in the minds of the devastated students . up until about this point the film is effective enough . however , an investigation begins into liz \\' s death and the film becomes excessively dull . the recently rediscovered talents of pam grier are thoroughly wasted in the role of detective vera cruz and the film is downright insipid in its treatment of both the characters and the audience during this long middle stretch . courtney \\' s plan to frame a sleazy guy ( marilyn manson , in a brief cameo ) is never believable for a second . meanwhile , the audience is stuck watching a string of random events which fail to develop the characters or add anything of interest to the plot . julie leaves the group and begins a lame romance with aspiring actor zack ( chad christ ) . he apparently gives her the courage to turn on courtney but the way things develop only make julie look stupid . fern \\' s rise to popularity is equally lame . we do get the best scene in the film ( the only one with a spark of originality ) during this section . it \\' s a smart and subversive bit where courtney gets the high school \\' s resident jock stud dane ( ethan erickson ) to demonstrate , using a popsicle , exactly what he would like for her to do to him . it at least provides us with a look at courtney \\' s personality but the way the scene finishes doesn \\' t make any sense . stein is very conscious of the teen movie tradition he is working in and not only freely borrows major plot elements but also includes direct acknowledgment of this with some stunt casting . william katt and p . j . soles ( students in carrie ) are liz \\' s distraught parents , jeff conaway ( from grease ( 1978 ) ) is julie \\' s creepy single dad and carol kane ( the frightened babysitter in when a stranger calls ( 1979 ) ) camps it up as principal miss sherman . at times jawbreaker feels simply like teen cinema \\' s greatest hits but the audience is cheated with watered down interpretations of the best this genre has to offer . the only notable aspect of jawbreaker is the incredibly stylish look . the costume design by vickie brinkford and the production design by jerry fleming are both bright and vivid . they were apparently instructed to work from the color palette of a jawbreaker and the screen is always splashed with bits of vibrant color . director of photography amy vicent , who beautifully lensed eve \\' s bayou ( 1997 ) , does a remarkable job here as well . shot composition and camera movement is consistently impressive . performances are mostly sub - par with mcgowan providing only a few good moments ( compared with her excellent work in the doom generation ( 1995 ) and scream ( 1996 ) ) and gayheart making the biggest impression due to the sweet nature of her character and her obvious beauty . none of the actors look as if they have set foot inside a high school within the last five years with the exception of actress / singer tatyana ali , who has a small role as a cheerleader . the male cast all resemble male models and are credited with names like \" auto stud , \" \" college stud , \" and \" high school stud # 2 . \" the soundtrack is decent and imperial teen \\' s catchy \" yoo hoo \" makes a bigger impression than any other aspect of the film .',\n",

       " ('shakespeare . you hardly understood it in high school . why would you want more of it now that your english grade doesn \\' t count on it ? if this is your attitude , then i \\' ll say right off the bat that kenneth branagh \\' s hamlet is probably not for you , and you might as well stop reading right now . if , however , you are a lover of the bard , or at the very least are open - minded about a challenging script , read on , for there is something rotten in the state of denmark . namely , the king has died , and his widow the queen has wed the king \\' s brother , claudius , but prince hamlet suspects foul play . his suspicions are confirmed when the ghost of his father appears and relates the story of his murder at his own brother \\' s hands . hamlet , enlisting the help of his friend horatio , conspires to capture the conscience of the new king to expose his treachery . . . . and the game is afoot . . . . the first things you notice about this production are the sets and costumes . with external scenes filmed at blemheim palace in england ( also the one of the sites for the recent the avengers ) , the grandiose quality of the setting is immediately established . interior scenes are similarly graced with intricate and flamboyant rooms and chambers . the hamlet castle \\' s grand throne room is an impressive piece of work incorporating high ceilings , mirror - panel doors , and bridges which connect opposite sides of a second - story loft . costuming is equally grand , drawing upon both history and imagination . . not quite the denmark of the 1600 \\' s , the characters \\' attire is something of a cross between that era and turn of the century russia , very effectively giving the film more of a timeless feel . it is not surprising that tim harvey and alexandra byrne were nominated for best art direction and best costume design oscars , respectively . in addition to directing , kenneth branagh also plays the title character . as the revenge - driven royal heir , branagh provides a riveting performance of emotional highs and lows . from the anticipation of seeing his father \\' s ghost , to the melancholy of finding the burial site of his childhood jester , to his eventual wrath , branagh delivers in spades . every scene truly revolves around hamlet , as much a tribute to branagh \\' s acting and directing as to shakespeare \\' s manuscript . hamlet seems to be a who \\' s who of shakespearean - trained actors , so watching them perform the craft for which they have much love is a delight in itself . julie christie , as hamlet \\' s mother gertrude , and derek jacobi as his murderous uncle claudius both fill the classic roles superbly , as do many of the supporting players . kate winslet as hamlet \\' s lover ophelia , does an outstanding job demonstrating the character \\' s plummet to the depths of dispair and madness . richard briers as ophelia \\' s father , polonius , and michael moloney as her brother , laertes , are equally convincing . nicholas farrell as hamlet \\' s trusted friend horatio , and timothy spall and reece dinsdale as the two - timing rosencrantz and guildenstern round out the excellent core cast . hamlet also seems to be a film in which someone tried to stuff as many well known actors as possible . in some cases , this made for interesting scenes . billy crystal is surprisingly good as the gravedigger who unearths the skull of yorick , whom hamlet knew quite well . crystal proves himself able to deliver the lines with both the timing of a classic actor and the verbal countenance of a comedian , and the result is a very funny scene . however , charleton heston , whom many might think would butcher shakespeare , is the biggest surprise of all . as the player king , the leader of a troupe of traveling actors , he is absolutely breathtaking when narrating the story of priam and hecuba . part of his monologue is overlaid with a visual enactment of the story ( with sir john gielgud and judi dench ) , but this is most unfortunate , for it robs heston of some of the attention which he deserves at this time . his off - camera speaking , while gripping , sort of downplays the scene to a narration done by any other well - voiced actor . i wish branagh had chosen to allow us to envision in our own minds the scene which heston lays out , and let the venerable actor have the attention . unfortunately , there were some casting choices which led to poor distractions . jack lemmon , an excellent actor , just can \\' t do shakespeare . as marcellus , the guard who sees the elder hamlet \\' s ghost , lemmon sadly underperforms and is shown up left and right by those around him . gerard depardieu , another talented actor , is wasted when given little more than the utterances of \" yes , my lord \" and \" no , my lord \" in the role of reynaldo . richard attenborough has a ( literally ) walk - on role , showing up at the eleventh hour as the english ambassador . i think he had two lines . then there is rufus sewell as fortinbras of norway . when i went to see dangerous beauty earlier this year , two ladies behind me kept commenting about how handsome he was . if bulging eyes are your idea of handsome , well i guess comic actor marty feldman was some kind of sex symbol to you . hamlet is a complicated tale of treachery and revenge in which triumph and defeat become one . branagh attempts to help us out with some of the intricacies by visually representing some of the more elusive stretches of dialogue by presenting them as flashback - type images . this only works about half the time , and i wonder if it would have been just as well to do without them . you don \\' t have to be some kind of genius to appreciate shakespeare , but it is quite difficult to understand unless you have the time to read or hear it carefully and repeatedly . the alternate method of comprehension is that with which most of us are familiar , the high school english course . in it , you are hopefully fortunate enough to have an educator willing to help you with the plot points and nuances essential to understanding a play written in the rigmarole known as the king \\' s english . or i suppose you could just read the cliff notes .',\n",

( except for a few unintended laughs once a while . ) and before you know it , treat williams , wes studi and famke jansen appear on the big screen . hey ! i know them guys ( and gal ) from a couple of other movies . cool . familiar faces . so far so good . our man treat is the hero , he \\' ll live . wes is a staple of b movies , he is the token victim . we know he \\' ll buy the farm but he will take a few creeps with him on the way out . famke is the babe , \\' nuff said . there is also a guy with glasses ( the guy with glasses always dies ) a black person ( b movie buffs know that the black guy always dies , never fails ) and a very funny , nerdy guy . ( ah ! comic relief . how can we possibly explain having to kill him . . . let him live . ) after the first fifteen minutes i felt right at home . i know who to root for and who i need to boo too and a gum to chew . ( please kill me . ) suffice it to say that for the next hour and a half i jumped out of my seat a few times , went \" ewwww \" about a dozen times and nearly had an orgasm over all the explosions and firepower our heroes were packing . i \\' m a man , we nottice these things . all in all , i \\' d recommend deep rising if you are looking for a good time and care to leave your brain at the door . . . but bring your sense of humor and excitement in with you . the acting is decent , the effects top rate . how to best describe it ? put together the jet ski scene from hard rain , the bug attacks from starship troopers , a couple of james bond like stunts and all those scenes from friday the thirteenth and freddy where you keep screaming \" don \\' t go there , he \\' s behind you \" and you end up with deep rising . for creepy crawly goodness , tight t - shirts , major firepower and the need to go to the bathroom every fifteen minutes from seing all that water .',\n",

       " (\"there must be some unwritten rule that states , one gets enlightenment not in the way one expects to get enlightenment but in the commitment given to seeking wisdom , even if it is a foolish road one is on and it seems to be leading nowhere . in the exotic morocco of 1972 , a 25 - year - old english hippie mother , julia ( winslet ) , of two sweet young girls , the 6 - year - old lucy ( carrie ) and the 8 - year - old bea ( bella ) , has arrived for a year ' s stay , with the self - absorbed mother oblivious to how her daughters might be adjusting to this foreign experience while she is searching for a change of life from her unfaithful poet husband ( she is not officially married to him ) and her cold one - room london flat , and is sort of looking for the eternal truth in the sunny climate of marrakech . at least she says she is , as she is making some attempt to contact a sufi sheikh there who has all the answers . she has not planned things out too carefully , having no money , and the trip doesn ' t seem like it ' s much fun , more like a misadventure , with some romance with a local moroccan thrown in . drugs , a world - wide youthful phenomena during this period , where many westerners came to morocco to smoke the good hashish found there and to live the ' good life ' cheaply , and to be in a spot where they did not have to worry about being hassled by the local authorities , even though drugs are illegal there . but this is not shown as one of her reasons for being here . in this film , the subject of drugs is never broached , only hinted at in an off - handed but slurring way , as the hippie commune is shown in a negative light , strumming on their guitars and bragging about the hits of acid they have taken . even the ones coming here for spiritual reasons , to follow the mystical sufis , seem lost following a culture that is far different from where they were coming from . the film is based on the novel that contained the autobiographical experiences of sigmund freud ' s grand - daughter , esther freud , who traveled here in the 1960s with her mother and sister . it is written by the director ' s brother , who has previously directed regeneration , the playboys , and trojan eddie . the title of the film comes from the squealing giggles that saying hideous kinky gives the little girls . with julia strapped for cash and not receiving a needed check her husband often forgets to send her , she is prevented from seeing the greatest living sufi who is located in algeria ; so instead , she meets an acrobat street performer in the bazaar , bilal ( said taghmaoui ) . he becomes her lover , taking the place of her husband as a father figure for the girls . the girls readily accept him , and there is no big - to - do made about their openly sexual relationship , but the girls really don ' t know what to make of the relationship . it especially bothers bea , who is embarrassed by her mother ' s loose attitude and wants to go home . things go surprisingly sour when bilal takes them to stay in his small village . it seems only that bilal ' s charm is matched by his shiftlessness , as he has a wife who still lives there . this scene didn ' t make too much sense as to why he would take them there knowing the situation , unless the uneducated man was totally uneducated in the customs of his people , also . but i doubt that . the family is now stuck without money in a backward area trying to decide what to do next , as they hitch a ride away from there with a truck driver who nearly kills them when he falls asleep by the wheel . lucy takes it all in stride and has a good disposition for travel , while bea just wants to go to a school and learn something and be a ' normal ' girl . the beauty of marrakech is matched by the terrific performance of kate winslet , as the film accurately encapsulates the timeless city and its bustling street scenes , expansive views , illustrious mosques , and grand sunsets . kate enacts the feel of what it was like to be a westerner , living out the countercultural experiences while awaiting to gather her sensibilities again and was fortunate enough to be able to go home the better off for her experiences , as many a drop - out reluctantly had to do after their stay ran out of money and purpose . the background music from groups like america and jefferson airplane , provided further nostalgia for this easy to look at and easy to grasp film . the only hope was that the two innocent girls would not be permanently harmed while on this sojourn , a venture that should be reserved only for those of college age or older who choose to go there for themselves . the family ' s travel , which is on the edge , has julia waking up screaming from dreams that are bleakly haunting ; but , when she gets up , all there is , is this splendid emptiness all around her and a vacuous life that is starting to bother her . that marrakech is disarmingly gorgeous and that london is old hat to her , is starting to wear thin in her thoughts . it will dawn on her , when bea takes ill , as she reflects on what the sufi guru tells her , whom she finally meets and is driven to tears in his presence . he is the guru who replaced the one she wanted to see but who died before she got a chance to see him . the new guru is grounded in reality , something she is not grounded in , and seems to tell her what she couldn ' t comprehend from anyone else , even comforting her , by telling her that her tears are memories - a gift from god . the film ' s weakness was the empty feeling i got from watching the story unfold in its risk free tenor ( she was there basically to be just escaping from her situation ) and how unappealing the love affair seemed between bilal and julia . the storyline about a helpless single parent , detracted from the vibrant experiences many others of her same baby - boom generation had during their trip to morocco , who were taken in by the mystical culture of sufism , a teaching that has a lot to offer its followers , contrary to the impression the film might give , seemed to pass her by . her knowledge of that trip is only surface deep , at best . she perhaps would have been better off not taking the kids along , smoking some hashish , and have been less assured of herself but to have behaved more like a hippie and she wouldn ' t have been so uptight all the time and had some fun on her journey . after all , the mystical trip is the journey . the film ' s strength is in how all the characters are shown for what they are , and no one is that good or that bad , or judged too harshly for their shortcomings . bilal is unreliable but is capable of generosity . the little girls are precocious but they are lovable . julia , the cornerstone the film is built on , is a mother who cares about the children but doesn ' t know how to take care of them without unintentionally harming them . she was trying to escape from reality and that by returning to london , she has another chance to see if she can find the key to this world or whatever world she is looking for and should no longer have nightmares about where she ' s at . this is a very freudian way to look at things , as this sudden realization , that things are not right puts an an end to her eastern hippie odyssey , at least , for the time being . and , after all is said and done , who ' s to say if the children are also not better off for surviving their experiences , just like she probably was !\",\n",

       " ('the thought - provoking question of tradition over morals is the subject directly at the core of \" leila , \" a powerfully articulated and subtle drama from famous iranian director dariush mehrjui , that is his first motion picture in a prosperous thirty - year career to gain u . s . distribution , thanks to first run features . although unfamiliar with mehrjui \\' s previous directing efforts , perhaps the reason for this is that , while the predicament at hand is no doubt exclusive to its own country , the heartbreaking and solely truthful emotions of the characters can easily be understood by all viewers . set in modern - day iran , \" leila \" begins on the birthday of the title character ( leila hatami ) , after a brief prologue in which we are shown the first encounter between leila and her future husband , reza ( ali mosaffa ) . as leila and reza set off to visit his parents , and then hers , where a birthday celebration has been planned , things seem rosy for the couple on the outside , but for leila , life isn \\' t quite as sweet . earlier , on that very same day , leila had gone to see her physician , and has ultimately discovered that she holds very little chance of ever conceiving a child . when all of the conditions are ruled out , and leila passes up the possibility of adoption , reza firmly and lovingly tells her that he married her , and doesn \\' t care at all about having children . nonetheless , leila is ashamed that she will never be able to give him a baby , which is the societal norm , and her self - esteem is not helped at all by her domineering mother - in - law ( jamileh sheikhi ) , whose hopes to carry on the sacred family name vanishes once hearing the news ( reza is her only son ) . bluntly explaining to leila that reza has always wished for children and , in a country where polygamy is an accepted tradition , she suggests that he take a second wife to bear a child with . leila hesitantly agrees , and while she and reza are able to shallowly laugh afterwards about the hopeful womens \\' inadequacies , reza finally does meet a woman whom he claims to like , even though he refuses to go through with the marriage if leila doesn \\' t give her full blessing . there are no easy answers to be found within \" leila , \" a film that thoughtfully examines the central character \\' s unfortunate plight , as well as the inner workings of leila herself , told through matter - of - fact narration . almost completely taken over by her own shame , she has no option but to agree to her forceful mother - in - law \\' s requests , even though she is unsure of how she will react if reza really does end up marrying another woman . maybe because \" leila \" is from iran , the film will unquestionably be shocking for american audiences , since the concept of polygamy is looked upon by the characters as a more or less everyday occurrence . leila , however , is unable to come to terms with the idea quite as easily , but feels it is her duty to make her husband happy , no matter what the circumstances . one of the strongest aspects of the film is in its portrayal of the relationship between leila and reza , who married only three months after their first meeting , but obviously love each other very deeply . it is this relationship that is the key ingredient to making what follows the opening scenes all the more powerful , and director mehrjui has succeeded just about as well as possible . although seemingly unimportant at first glance , an early sequence where leila and reza are eating dinner and both are laughing , nearly uncontrollably , actually is one of the most vital moments in the first half , as it unmistakably sets the boundary for their unrequisite love for one another . ditto for another scene in which reza gives leila a large stuffed animal for her birthday , and then reveals a beautiful necklace he has also gotten her . these \" small \" moments are the perfect contrast for the solemn , outraging sequences in the latter half , in which reza drops leila off at the side of a busy road , and then zooms off to go on a date with another woman . left there to ponder her quickly diminishing marriage , foolishly unbeknownst to reza , leila prays each time that the date will not go well , so she will be able to keep her husband to herself for a little while longer . refusing to stay over at her parent \\' s house , the film inevitably leads up to the second wedding night between reza and another woman , and in a sequence of extraordinary sorrow and potency , leila finds her whole being emotionally torn apart , as she is closed up in an upstairs bedroom as the marriage proceedings are going on down below . despite her initial agreement to such a thing , leila realizes how much she has been betrayed by reza , whom she believed cared for her as much as she did of him . sure , the whole second marriage was his mother \\' s idea , but if he really did believe what he initially had told her about not wanting any children , then he could have still easily backed out , couldn \\' t he ? in the pivotal role of leila , who appears in every scene , leila hatami is nothing short of remarkable , injecting her character with an equal measure of startling strength , unavoidable vulnerability , and utter despair . unlike most american films , in which everything always has to be spelled out for audiences , hatami says much more with just an elusive expression on her face than could possibly have been conveyed by words . every bit a perfect match for hatami is ali mosaffa , as reza , a man who , i believe , does hold an unbreakable bond with his wife , but is too naive to realize what he will be doing to leila if he marries someone else . for all of its strong aspects , \" leila \" isn \\' t a perfect film . on a technical level , i found many blatant punctiation and spelling mistakes within the subtitles that need to be fixed . and concerning the plot developments , the final five minutes ring false when compared with everything that has come before . mehrjui \\' s decision to use an extremely stylized approach to the ending was the wrong choice , particularly in his almost comedic way of wrapping up the character of the spiteful mother - in - law , played memorably by jamileh sheikhi . despite these minor missteps , \" leila \" is an important motion picture that should definately be sought out upon its limited may 16 release at new york \\' s cinema village , and then on may 21 in la . the thought -

       " ('there is a scene early in jakob the liar that hints at how much better it could have been . the scene is set in a jewish ghetto in poland circa 1944 , where a one - time cafe proprietor named jakob heym is walking resolutely through the streets , fists stuffed into coat pockets . to one side of him , residents scavenge for food in the street ; to the other side , german troops beat a group of jews . jakob , however , never stops moving . it \\' s an efficient , effective set - up for the character , who is clearly nobody \\' s idea of a hero at the outset . he is a man who has responded to the horror of his surroundings by withdrawing from them , excising his moral peripheral vision . the set - up is critical because fate will turn jakob into a reluctant savior . after a visit to a german commandant \\' s office and a moment alone with a turned - on radio , jakob learns that russian troops are quite near . when he brings this first news of the war in years to his fellow jews , they become convinced that he must have a radio , which is a punishable offense in the ghetto . the good news brings hope to the ghetto ; the everyday specter of suicide vanishes . a private man of limited creativity finds himself burdened with creating stories of russian military progress just to keep his neighbors alive . this promising story of an ordinary person doing the extraordinary is burdened from the outset by casting : the \" ordinary person \" in question , jakob heym , is played by robin williams . i am of the depressing opinion that williams is growing less assured as an actor in his \" serious \" roles with every passing year . compare his dramatic scenes in the world according to garp and moscow on the hudson with what dreams may come or patch adams , and see how much more mannered he has become ( or , at the very least , how much less sensible at choosing material ) . jakob the liar depends on the notion that jakob has to struggle to craft his fictions , but williams always looks like he \\' s struggling _not_ to craft them . when he improvises a radio address by winston churchill for ailing 10 - year - old orphan lina ( hannah taylor gordon ) , he seems relieved that he can finally get wacky . oh yes , and then there \\' s that little girl . some viewers will undoubtedly consider the hero \\' s fanciful stories for a young charge too reminiscent of life is beautiful , but those scenes aren \\' t problematic because they \\' re familiar . they \\' re problematic because they \\' re jarring and distracting , introducing a cutesy relationship into a film that shouldn \\' t have been about cutesy relationships . jakob \\' s character arc may be about his willingness to act for the benefit of others , but there are plenty of others without poor little lina . every scene with her feels contrived , pulling jakob the liar away from its central story of hope coming to a previously hopeless people . it is a pleasant surprise to find that jakob the liar is a much grittier production than you might expect from a hollywood - ized holocaust , combining the weighty subject matter with dark humor in some effective ways . director peter kassovitz , working from jurek becker \\' s novel , crafts some nice scenes between jakob and the other townspeople , and draws solid performances from armin mueller - stahl ( as a once - revered doctor ) and bob balaban ( as a barber drifting into depression ) . there are just too many things going on that prove distracting , whether it \\' s the sketchy romanctic angle involving liev schreiber as an earnest former prizefighter , or williams \\' incongrous presence , or a sweet but utterly irrelevant little girl . jakob the liar deals with too delicate a subject for such fumbling , and has too compelling a central character to waste . and after one wonderful early scene , you can see the film wasted and fumbled away .',\n",

       " ('shakespeare in love is quite possibly the most enjoyable period piece ever made for the silver screen . it is both humorous and romantic in a very unique blend that can successfully entertain any audience for the nearly 2 and and a half hours that it occupies . that is , however , not to say it is a good film , a quality production or anything of the sort . shakespeare in love is an incredibly cheap illusion that truly pans out to be very little quality or original work . the finest sign of this may be the plot , in looking back , there seems to be little more than a thin , predictable plot that is only carried by the portrayal of people that we revere in our history books . philip henslowe ( geoffrey rush ) owns 1 of the 2 theatres in london . it is at the peak of the royal theatre era , and queen elizabeth ( the recently damed judi dench , by , appropriately enough , queen elizabeth ii ) is very much a fan . however , to directly quote the film , he has \" cash flow problems . \" through a long set of events , it becomes apparent that his entire life is dependent on his next show doing well enough to pay off his debts . so , mr . henslowe employs the young playwright , william shakespeare ( joseph fiennes ) to pen a comedic production . however , the young writer has a severe case of writer \\' s block , and blames it on the fact that his love life is struggling as well . he has the title in mind , romeo and ethel , the pirate \\' s daughter ( even that joke loses steam after a while ) but can \\' t seem to put words to paper . then , as only hollywood could have it , through a long set of twisted events , he meets viola de lesseps ( gwyneth paltrow ) and falls madly in love , thus curing his writer \\' s block . there are many other little issues that mr . henslowe encounters , but they all pan out to be much ado about nothing . the first realization that i reached in watching this film is that one of the messages given is that a show should not always be credited to it \\' s author . ironically , that couldn \\' t be truer here . the great scenes that will sweep audiences away are not the scenes that fit in the plot , but rather the recitals of shakespearean lines by actors playing actors . one of the most breathtaking moments in this film does not involve the character of shakespeare or queen elizabeth or even the theatre owner , but rather 2 young children named romeo and juliet who chose to end their own lives in the name of love . so it is that i am offended by the fact that marc norman and tom stoppard are credited with writing this production , and the name william shakespeare is no were to be seen beyond a character \\' s name in the credits . the acting in this entertaining yet poor film is often thin to the point that it would not have survived even in queen elizabeth \\' s theatres . joseph fiennes may just be the worst of fall though . he is tragically unbelievable and comically bad . gwyneth paltrow is little more than satisfactory in her lead position as well . however , the supporting cast does almost save the day . geoffrey rush is nothing short of incredible and judi dench is breathtaking . they both seem to have shown that as proven actors they could survive in this film of weak links . you will also find a very good performance by ben affleck in his first real role since good will hunting ( no , armageddon doesn \\' t qualify as real acting . ) . and rupert everett was cute in his small part as well . but not even they could save this sad excuse for a film , so it remains plagued by poor performances . when all is said and done , shakespeare in love is only worth the trip if you want to be entertained . however , as the film so kindly pointed out , entertainment may be fun , but it isn \\' t necessarily quality . and this certainly isn \\' t quality . perhaps this may be best compared to a john grisham novel , as a dear friend of mine often does compare things to his work . simply put , it is far - fetched , poorly crafted , but very entertaining .',\n",

aliens sans flamethrowers . the visual effects were by far the best thing about species , and the sequel \\' s effects crew at steve johnson \\' s xfx inc . keeps that high - quality tradition alive ; no cheap - looking lost in space cgi here . after the effects , the original \\' s best asset was the fresh presence of henstridge . however , medak and brancato have no idea what exactly to do with her for this installment . at one point she \\' s called on to play alien \" empath \" ? la forest whitaker in the original , but for most of the duration she \\' s holed up in a glass cell . by the time the big breakout so prominently featured in the trailer actually takes place , the film is well into its home stretch . so the rest of the time we are treated to patrick , played with little zest by lazard . one problem with the first film was that the deadly , horny , but innocent - at - heart sil was too sympathetic ; no such problem with patrick , who comes off as a cocky pretty boy before the alien takes control . the rest of the cast also fails to add much , but the writing can be faulted for that . helgenberger and madsen go through the motions , but they are already hampered by the clich ? d development that somewhere between the two films , the once - linked laura and press stopped getting along . williamson suffers the worst indignity . he tries his best to enliven the token african - american role , but how can anyone recite insulting , derivative lines such as \" i \\' m gonna get african on someone \\' s ass \" and not appear ridiculous ? but species ii \\' s worst crime is being a thoroughly uninteresting piece of work . at least the original featured plenty to laugh at -- unaccountably awful performances by the otherwise fine actors ben kingsley and whitaker , and the sight of helgenberger \\' s character performing fellatio on madsen \\' s , for a start . but the filmmakers do not display any discernable effort at all , let alone the misguided effort that is required for something to reach the camp level . for all the blood and gore , nudity , and sex thrown in , species ii is , quite simply , a vapid bore .',\n",

       " ('the general \\' s daughter is a heartless , absurd film , a movie so hopelessly dedicated to its inane plot that it forgets entirely about its own characters . director simon west treats issues like rape and sexual fetish with ham - handed obscenity , creating a film that banks almost entirely on exploitation and offensive pseudo - depth . what \\' s worse is that the movie is haphazardly glued together by two characters who are neither interesting nor sympathetic -- the ridiculous story requires them to do unbelievable things in the interest of reaching a dark conclusion in a sudden rain storm . john travolta finds himself in the middle of the mess , playing warrant officer paul brenner ; brenner is assigned to find the murderer and rape of captain elizabeth campbell ( leslie stefanson ) , daughter of general joe campbell ( james cromwell ) . brenner is teamed up with ex - spouse sarah sunderland ( madeline stowe ) , and they check out all the suspects on the base , including elizabeth \\' s mentor , colonel moore ( james woods ) . soon , it becomes apparent that elizabeth was into kinky sexual stuff , but the question comes down to why -- and , of course , who . ebert \\' s law of the economy of characters can be applied here ; one interesting thing i noted is that not only are all the characters suspects at some point ( including the two protagonists ) , but almost all of them end up directly intertwined with the story . perhaps i should have issued a spoiler alert before mentioning that , but it \\' s painfully obvious from the beginning that everyone in the film is hiding something . on a story level , the general \\' s daughter is ineptly constructed . the film , adapted by christopher bertolini and william goldman from nelson demille \\' s novel ( which was apparently based on a true story ) , plods along to its conclusion , filling in the blanks with stale , unrealistic dialogue and \" shocking \" plot developments . having not read the novel , it \\' s difficult to determine if these problems are the fault of the adapters or the original author , but i suppose they all are guilty to some degree . scene after scene stumbles with pointless insincerity ; minutes after finding the dead young woman , brenner and sunderland engage in sarcastic dialogue , which includes endless strings of forced lines . ( sunderland actually asks brenner , \" why was she killed ? \" to which i would have answered , \" if i knew , then the movie would already be over . \" ) only after we \\' ve spent twenty minutes or so with these characters do we learn that they have a sordid history together ; this angle , though apparently present to develop their characters , is never explored . not that it really matters , since the characters consistently do ludicrous things for no other reason than to drive the plot . in one scene , sunderland is attacked by a man in a mask . she sees one of his rings , and she and brenner find the man later that day based on the ring . instead of questioning him like as they would a real suspect , they take him to brenner \\' s houseboat , beat him up , and pour hot coffee in his lap . this scene really pushed me over the edge , not because it \\' s gratuitous and mean - spirited , but because it illustrates the film \\' s complete disregard for the characters and the audience . it was impossible for me to feel anything for these people beyond this scene , mostly because nothing they do comes as a surprise . i realized that these constructs on screen aren \\' t actually characters , but devices present only to serve the story . this would have been bad enough without the west \\' s need to hose his movie down in tasteless images of rape and sexual misconduct . compelling films about sexual crimes don \\' t spend a lot of time on rape flashbacks , and they certainly don \\' t show as much skin and sweat as a typical pornographic picture . these scenes are not the least bit powerful ; on the contrary , they \\' re intended simply to provide the audience with the necessary resentment for the villain , whomever that may turn out to be . in addition , the movie treats sexual fetishes -- and sadomasochism in particular -- as if it \\' s a perversion of everything we know to be pure . this standpoint is certainly allowed , but only in accompaniment with well - developed themes to back it up . as it is , the film forgets that a lot of people have sexual fetishes , and that putting on a pair of handcuffs does not make a person insane . perhaps the only positive elements in the general \\' s daughter are a couple of the performances . james woods has a few terrific scenes , and plays his role with sharp , witty subtlety . i also liked james cromwell , mostly because he comes across as slightly sympathetic despite the obvious intent of west to make him villainous . nonetheless , these performances are undermined entirely by the dreary , obligatory atmosphere and the senseless neglect of characterization . the general \\' s daughter is the worst kind of hollywood film -- it pretends to have a soul , to be of strict moral code , when in fact it has nothing more than a group of cardboard cut - outs force - feeding the audience a toxic landfill of plot contrivances and one - sided moral judgments .',\n",

       " ('set in the late 80 \\' s at the height of yuppie excess and based on the book by bret easton ellis ( who explored the same themes in another book which was also made into a movie , less than zero ) , american psycho puts a new spin on the yuppie \" genre \" that ellis helped to create . christian bale is perfectly cast as patrick bateman , a high powered yuppie who hides a terrible secret from his fianc ? e and his colleagues . it seems that bateman is a serial killer and , unfortunately for his contemporaries , his tenuous grasp on reality is starting to slip . as he tries to balance his meticulous daily routines with slaughtering co - workers and prostitutes and hiding their bodies , his mental fabric slowly begins to unravel . i was first introduced to the novel when i was still in high school . i read an associated press article in our local sunday newspaper detailing the problems ellis was having getting his novel published due to the controversial violence in it . as usual when anything is controversial i try to seek it out , but i soon forgot about the novel and didn \\' t end up thinking about it again until i stumbled across it a couple of years later at a bookstore . i picked it up and read it , but was ultimately disappointed because it left more questions than answers . the movie has a similar effect , but at least it \\' s less cryptic than ellis \\' novel . for once , a film has actually turned out to be better than the novel it was based on . both the book and the film open with bateman describing his fastidious morning preparations ( down to exactly what facial scrubs and exfoliating creams he uses ) but the novel seems to concentrate more on these excesses throughout . the movie continues to touch upon these things but makes more of a point to immerse us in bateman \\' s impending madness than to detail things as painstakingly as the novel does . as a result , the film is immensely more entertaining . lions gate seems to be the studio champion of controversial films ( having picked up kevin smith \\' s catholic - rattling dogma ) and here with american psycho there is no difference . screenwriters mary harron and guinevere turner had the unenviable task of trying to take a novel about yuppies filled with graphic violence and sex and make a marketable film out of it . some cuts had to be made to the finished film to keep from getting an nc - 17 , mainly involving a sex scene comprising bateman and two women , and initial reports said the film was unwatchable . thankfully , it is watchable and harron and turner have made one of the most scathingly satirical films this side of south park : bigger , longer & uncut . side note # 1 : co - writer guinevere turner also makes an appearance in the film as an ill - fated acquaintance of bateman \\' s who , after bateman suggests that she start making out with a female prostitute , proclaims that she \\' s not a lesbian nor has any interest in it . the ironic humor of the scene stems from the fact that turner ( the writer / director of the film go fish and who also assisted kevin smith with parts of his script for chasing amy ) is a lesbian . it \\' s a subtle in - joke and it \\' s one i found to be pretty humorous . despite having a rather high profile supporting cast of young up - and - comers ( including reese witherspoon ) , most of the roles are a waste and are the equivalent of extended billed cameos . the real draw here is christian bale and his over - the - top performance as patrick bateman . whenever i read a novel i always try to imagine what it would be like as a movie and who would be perfect to cast as the characters . i always had a hard time trying to decide who i would cast as bateman , but i never thought bale would deliver a performance as perfect as his ends up being . to say bale runs away with the character is a vast understatement and he proves that he \\' s as adept at chewing scenery as al pacino or rod steiger . one sequence in particular , involving bateman describing his love for huey lewis and the news \\' song \" hip to be square \" right before burying an axe in a co - worker \\' s head , features one of the most eccentric and kinetic performances i have ever seen on film . side note # 2 : despite the fact that huey lewis \\' \" hip to be square \" and a pair of phil collins songs appear in the film , don \\' t expect to see them on the soundtrack release . huey lewis expressly requested that his song , featured in a rather large set piece in the film ( much akin to the use of \" stuck in the middle with you \" in reservoir dogs ) , not be included on any soundtrack release . i \\' m assuming that collins requested the same . on a similar note , whitney houston \\' s cover of \" the greatest love of all \" is also involved in a scene comparable to the other two and it is very obvious that it isn \\' t the houston version at all but merely an instrumental version culled from an unknown source . apparently , houston wasn \\' t as open about the use of her song as the others were . a bigger controversy than the violence and sex has been brewing since the film \\' s release : that of whether or not patrick has actually committed the crimes we have viewed during the course of the film . don \\' t look to the book for any answers because it will only serve to confuse you more . several web sites have been dedicated to the subject but i \\' m still undecided . there is evidence both for and against but the most scathing evidence against comes from a scene near the end of the film where bateman goes on a killing spree taking out cops , old ladies , and cleaning staff with equal gusto . the scene seemed very dream - like and as absurd as the action films it suddenly seems to be parodying ( as an example , bateman blows up a police car very cinematically after firing several shots from a handgun in the general direction of the car ) . i kept waiting for bateman to wake up and for the film to continue on from there , but bateman never does wake up and the whole sequence , though comic , throws the film off - balance ( which i suppose was the intention ) . other than the few flaws i have mentioned , american psycho is an incredibly entertaining film ( although you may not leave the movie fully understanding whether or not what has just transpired actually occurred in bateman \\' s reality ) . i think this movie is destined for greatness as a cult film and deserves the spot it will take as such . it may not change anyone \\' s life , but it will certainly have an effect . i know i will certainly hear \" hip to be square \" in a different context the next time i hear it .

       " ('steven spielberg \\' s \" amistad , \" which is based on the true story of a group of africans who revolted on board a slave ship , then were captured and taken to america where a legal dispute ensued over who \" owned \" them , is concerned with several different aspects of this story . first , the film addresses the issue of the inherent evils of slavery . second , it deals with the historical involvement of several american politicians in the case , including president martin van buren and former president john quincy adams ( anthony hopkins ) . last , and most importantly , it examines the cultural confusion experienced by the africans who were forced into slavery and the damage done to their native culture in africa by the slave trade . \" amistad \" succeeds at least partly with all three of these elements . i have to admit that i was a little skeptical as to how much i could really get out of another \" anti - slavery \" movie . having seen several other movies and documentaries about slavery , i doubted that there was much i didn \\' t already know about it . fortunately , i turned out to be wrong . for one thing , spielberg \\' s camera never once gets near a southern plantation and instead sticks to the slave ships and the slave traders \\' operations in africa , so \" amistad \" was dealing with a different part of the history of slavery from the very beginning . and some of the images here are , in fact , much more harrowing than what we usually see in movies about slavery . one scene in the middle , in which the crew of a slave ship dispose of some of their \" excess \" slaves by throwing them overboard to drown , has to be one of the most disturbing film images of the year . spielberg digs farther into the evils of slavery than i was expecting he would , and in fact he probably goes about as far as a movie director can without getting an nc - 17 rating . the stark suffering of the africans is contrasted sharply with the shallow luxury of the politicians , such as president van buren and queen isabella of spain , whose naval officers were involved in the legal dispute and who was only a small child at the time . exposing politicians as narrow - minded , opportunistic hypocrites is fairly standard stuff , of course , but spielberg and writer david franzoni do it well enough that it still comes off as something more than just a simple exercise in audience manipulation . the film also examines the contentious nature of the slavery issue at the time , such that john quincy adams ( and probably other politicians like him ) , who clearly disapproved of the practice , was reluctant to get involved in the case until it was appealed all the way to the supreme court . the biggest success of \" amistad \" is probably the characterization of cinque ( djimon hounsou ) , who emerges as the de facto leader of the kidnapped africans and struggles to communicate with baldwin ( matthew mcconaughey ) , the lawyer who represents them in court . through cinque , we are given a window into the native culture , as he and the displaced africans try to explain to the prison guards what they need for a proper burial of a dead tribe member , or find an illustrated version of the bible and try to understand the story of jesus christ . cinque sees the dispute with a clarity and simplicity that , again , contrasts with the technicalities and mechanics of the legal process and of the political squabbles . \" what kind of country is this , where laws \\' almost \\' work ? \" he asks baldwin in bewilderment , when he learns that the case must be re - tried before the supreme court . spielberg \\' s direction tends a little bit towards the manipulative side at times , such as when he adds a heavy orchestral swell to cinque \\' s angry outburst in the court room . still , there isn \\' t enough of this for it to be a serious problem . the main flaw in this film , which prevents it from earning four stars , is that it seems like spielberg and franzoni can \\' t quite handle all of these issues at the same time , so instead they settle for addressing each one separately and simply editing the results into the same movie . this summer \\' s contact , for example , dealt with several issues at once , but each of them was somehow present in almost every scene and , most importantly , all of them were resolved at once . \" amistad \" tries to pull it all together in the end with a speech from adams , but it somehow feels a little forced , and in any case the speech itself , which lasts almost fifteen minutes , wears out its welcome about halfway through . perhaps the best way to describe it is this : \" amistad \" is three four star films edited into one . almost every individual scene works , but the final product is lacking the necessary focus and coherence , and thus is less than the sum of its parts . however , i can \\' t honestly say how it could have been done differently , and in any case the story comes through with enough raw emotional power that it is still a very good film , and thus i recommend it to anyone who can handle the disturbing imagery .',\n",

       " (\"with his successful books and movies , michael crichton is doing well . with early successes with westworld ( 1973 ) and coma ( 1978 ) , and recent films such as jurassic park ( 1993 ) , his films have been entertaining . however , he seems to taken a wrong turn somewhere with sphere . this $ 100 million mess by good director barry levison ( disclosure ) is dull , long winded , and a huge disappointment . considering the huge budget , the all star cast , and a story by crichton , sphere is majorly disappointing . the film opens with norman goodman ( hoffman ) , a psychologist who thinks he is visiting an airplane crash to console the survivors . however , when he arrives , he his told by supervisor barnes ( peter coyote ) that he is actually investigating an spacecraft . along with goodman is mathematician harry adams ( jackson ) , biologist beth halperin ( stone ) and ted fielding ( liev schrieber . ) they investigate the spaceship , find a massive sphere inside , meet an alien intelligence called jerry , and basically weird crap happens . unfortunately , something went wrong along the way with sphere . the film starts off entertaining enough , but throughout this very long movie , it just gets sillier and sillier . the film jaunts along from scene to scene , never fully explaining what is going on . the actors and directing don ' t help , either . hoffman is on autopilot ( and almost seems embarrassed ) throughout the movie , churning out dull lines , and probably wondering what the hell he is doing in this movie . stone is useless , displaying no emotion , and fails to convince the audience that she has any feelings for hoffman . the only person who seems to be having fun in this movie is jackson , who ' s funny as the mathematician who slowly goes crazy and entering the sphere . but he ' s hardly in it , and by the end of the film he is just as dull as hoffman and stone . the same goes for peter coyote , who hams it up as the officer , but is then killed off halfway through . the director , barry levinson , who directed the better crichton adaptation disclosure ( 1994 ) messes up with the drama and the action . the drama scenes are , quite frankly , boring , and the action scenes suffer from overkill , with levison throwing the camera all over the place ( much like the godawful speed 2 , 1997 ) the writing doesn ' t help much , either . although crichton is great with plots , he ' s terrible with dialogue , and practically every line in sphere is a dud . the speech is too simple , i was hoping it would be a bit more intelligent . practically every line is just stating the obvious . none of it is smart . also , where the hell did the budget go ? the sphere itself is impressive , and there ' s a few nice special effect shots , but where the $ 100 million went is anyone ' s guess . there ' s a giant squid attack in the picture , but not once does the audience see the squid , even though the film has a massive budget . i assume the picture was trying to build up tension by not showing the squid , and if handled correctly it probably would . but the whole scene is done badly , and i was just hoping we could see the stupid squid . finally , the film has no idea what genre to be . levison can ' t handle his own plot . it leaps from hokey sci - fi , to horror , and finally the shining / event horizon psychological thriller . and , of course , the film is very much like the abyss ( 1988 ) , although in it ' s defense , crichton did write sphere before the abyss was released ( and is far superior to this rubbish . ) it ' s not all that bad though . the plot is all right , there ' s a few jump scenes ( although nothing very scary ) and there ' s the occasionally interesting bit . but overall , sphere is a big waste of some fine talent , a lot of money , and a potentially good movie . not really worth seeing . overall rating = review by david wilcock\",\n",

       " ('most sequels don \\' t do what they \\' re supposed to do like \" toy story 2 \" does . far too many of them end up re - hashing the original and adding very little . is it any wonder that most sequels fail to live up to their predecessors ? thankfully , \" toy story 2 \" is a wonderful exception . i can \\' t remember the last time i saw a sequel as consistently fun and inventive as this one . it \\' s yet another sign that pixar , the acclaimed animation studio behind \" toy story \" and \" a bug \\' s life , \" is still at the top of its game . woody and buzz are back in the sequel to the 1995 hit \" toy story , \" and things have changed a bit since the last one ended . woody ( voiced by tom hanks ) is preparing to leave with his owner andy for cowboy camp . in his absence , he has assigned buzz lightyear ( tim allen ) , now comfortable in his role as a toy , to take charge . unfortunately , woody \\' s trip is ruined when he is accidentally put into the family garage sale , and is stolen by an over - zealous toy collector ( wayne knight ) . off to save him are buzz and members of the old \" toy gang , \" including mr . potato head ( don rickles ) , rex the nervous dinosaur ( wallace shawn ) , hamm the piggy bank ( john ratzenberger ) , and slinky dog ( jim varney ) . while in captivity , woody makes a startling discovery : he is actually part of a collection of toys based on a 1950 \\' s children \\' s show entitled \" woody \\' s roundup . \" he meets the show \\' s other characters , which include jesse ( joan cusack ) , his cowgirl sidekick , the wise old prospector ( kelsey grammer ) , and bullseye , his trusty horse . they have all been anxiously awaiting woody \\' s arrival , as once their set is completed , they will be sold to a japanese toy museum , and finally escape storage forever . this means woody now faces a difficult choice . with his friends coming to rescue him , does he go with them and spend a few more years with andy , or does he go to japan and be immortalized forever ? as in the original film , \" toy story 2 \" contains first - rate animation , and pixar studios has done a remarkable job improving on the impressive work they did there . reportedly , the film was originally slated for a direct - to - video release , but after seeing the improvements that had been made , disney rightly decided to release it into theaters . the film is well worth seeing on the big screen . the colors are bright , the textures sharp , and even the human characters look more \" human . \" the animation is consistently seamless , with the action fast and furious and the facial expressions believable . there are so many impressive sequences that i \\' d find it impossible to list them here , but i was particularly wowed by a scene where buzz and his cohorts must get across a busy intersection to get to al \\' s toy barn , the store owned by woody \\' s captor . pixar \\' s rendition of the family dog is also nicely done , with fur so realistic you almost feel you could reach out and touch it . the voice work is also perfectly complementary , and as with the first movie , does much to help further character development . tom hanks and tim allen again disappear into their roles as woody and buzz , making you forget who is doing the voice . it was woody and buzz up there , not tom and tim . all the cast members from the original reprise their roles , and each is excellent . several new voices have been added , with joan cusack , kelsey grammer , and wayne knight doing fine work . \" toy story 2 \" is strong in characterization , and is able to expand on what we saw in the first movie . woody faces difficult choices , while buzz is confronted with a new buzz who hasn \\' t yet realized his status as a toy , forcing him to see what he used to be like . the new characters are also developed quite well , especially jesse , who narrates a sarah mclachlan - aided flashback illustrating how she was loved , then forgotten by her owner . it may be computer - animated , and it may have sappy music , but it \\' s downright touching . the script , despite having a story and screenplay each credited to four different writers , is endlessly clever and inventive , especially considering that it \\' s a sequel . the reason \" toy story 2 \" works where other movie sequels fail is that it refuses to just capitalize on the original \\' s success by re - doing the same story and using the same characters . not this one . we get character change , new characters , and new issues brought up . \" toy story 2 \" is also remarkable for the way in which it keeps reinventing itself . there is always another clever idea waiting just around the corner here . the humor is sharp and witty , with something to amuse both kids and adults . there are funny asides to films such as \" star wars \" and \" jurassic park , \" among others , new takes on classic toys like barbie and rock \\' em sock \\' em robots , and appearances from other pixar efforts \" a bug \\' s life \" and the 1997 short \" geri \\' s game . \" ( geri himself makes an appearance as a toy repairman who fixes woody \\' s broken arm . ) the action is fast and furious , and the chases ( in the street , in a toy store , in an elevator , on a baggage carousel , and in an airplane ) keep getting bigger and better . \" toy story 2 \" never grows stagnant , because there is always something new to hold your interest . the more you pay attention to it , the more rewarding it is . it \\' s rare to see a film like \" toy story 2 \" come along , because it \\' s the kind of film that \\' s almost impossible to dislike . it \\' s created purely to entertain , and though i enjoy a thought - provoking drama as much as the next person , it \\' s nice to see that films are still trying to do exactly what movies first tried to do : send us out with a smile . it \\' s a fair bet that the whole family will have smiles on their collective faces after seeing \" toy story 2 . \" it \\' s the rare sequel that manages to expand on , and live up to , the original .',\n",

       " ('\" love is the devil \" is a challenging film , munundating its audience with wild imagery and a plot structure that disallows a plot , perhaps in an attempt to get us to know the artist \\' s psyche rather than the artist \\' s lifeline . watching it , i was enthralled with the look of the film , the way the director shot everything like it was looking through a bizarre , personalized filter . everything looks like it is not how life looks like but how painter francis bacon , the film \\' s subject , looked at it personally . but while i was engrossed , i stumbled upon my thoughts halfway through the film , awakened from my trance by some inner distraction , and began to try and follow what \\' s going on . exactly what was i looking at ? watching this film , i wasn \\' t sure if it was the most insightful film i had ever seen or the most vacuous . directed ( and written ) by john maybury , \" love is the devil \" is stylish masterpiece for the senses . everything looks originally bizarre and perplexing . the camera angles are ferociously askew , and the close - ups are uncomfortably too close . the editing is deft , occasionally cutting away to something bizarre every couple seconds , but other times holding on a shot for so long that you wonder if the audience is not supposed to be voyeurs , or rather , intruders to bacon \\' s world and psyche . as such , there is no real story . i \\' ve not heard much about francis bacon that i didn \\' t read prior to the film , but what i learned was this : he was a painter in england who reached his peak during the 60s and 70s , drawing hideously bizarre drawings of carnage and the like . he was one of the first to really come out of the closet , and in interviews , he was notoriously drunk yet incredibly witty . as played by great shakesperean actor derek jacobi , he \\' s like a foppish and self - absorbed cross between oscar wilde and nero . he lives life the way he wants to live it , to the disatisfaction of those who have the privelege of being really close to him . it \\' s as if he were taking delight in the destruction of others and maybe himself ( \" champagne for my real friends , and pain for my sham friends , \" he says one night at the bar he frequents ) . \" love is the devil \" chronicles the latter part of his life . bacon , well - known in his mid - life , awakens one night when he hears a man tumble through his ceiling window and land on the floor . he walks in , unafraid of what he finds , and discovers a thief , george dyer ( daniel craig ) . bacon gives him an offer : if he spends the night with him , he can take anything he wants in the morning . george agrees to this , and off to bed he goes , but ends up staying with him , for whatever reason . the film shows their lives together , at least in reference to one another . while creating bacon \\' s world of friends ( like \" high art , \" this film minors in showing a certain group of people who radiate a connection that is not shown but is understood ) , the film shows the relationship of bacon and george as it remains rather stagnant . bacon is haughty and bizarre ; george is simple and doesn \\' t understand bacon in the least , especially not his paintings . while watching this , that \\' s basically all i thought was there . the film has a hypnotic feel , free of any restraints of form , and is shot so uniquely that i felt my attention was almost entirely on the way this film was made rather than what it is about . once the film is over , it \\' s easier to piece it together . i kept on thinking about this film , wondering what the point to all of it was . someone doesn \\' t merely make a film of all style and no substance at all , and if they do , they do it by accident , but still allow some substance to creep in . thinking about it , i remembered how the two fed off of eachother . i thought about how bacon was a masochist , in love with cruelty ( in one scene , he watches a boxing match with a orgiastic delight , and lets out a squeal of pleasure when blood from the one boxer \\' s head splashes across his face ; in another scene , he masturbates to the odessa steps sequence of eisenstein \\' s \" battleship potemkin \" ) , and perhaps he drove george too far in his delight for pain . he drove him over the edge , and for him that was love , even if it wasn \\' t for george . i guess that explains the title . a bit . that \\' s great and all , but i almost wish the film was devoid of any meaning . i wish it hadn \\' t reduced itself to making some point about humanity , about how love is the most selfish thing in the world ( and it is , if you look at it a certain way ) . or maybe if it had avoided any meaning about humanity and merely drove itself into being the one film that was truly inside one man \\' s twisted pysche . it \\' s almost always best to obtain insights from looking at one man \\' s uniqueness than it is forcing universality down an audience \\' s throat . that way you don \\' t reduce your film to something it \\' s just not . i can \\' t say i totally enjoyed \" love is the devil , \" though . despite all of the things i respect about this movie , it \\' s still rather uncomfortable to sit through . even at a normally trite length of ninety minutes , the film still seems like an arduous task to sit through , especially after an exhausting first hour . though hypnotic , it still almost seems gimmicky and even redundant at times , as if it were taking advantage of one man \\' s truly bizarre nature but not doing anything deeper with it . as such , i respect the way the film looks . it \\' s beautiful and painstakingly crafted so that , along with \" what dreams may come \" and \" dark city , \" it \\' s the year \\' s most visually stunning film . in fact , if a better script had been forged , i \\' d almost compare it in visual power to a peter greenaway film , complete with similar haunting images that stick in the mind forever . and with a dymanite performance by derek jacobi , it has the comic and distanced tone that it needs . i just wish it had been more than mostly style and just a hair bit of substance . then i would have had something to hold me over even now .',\n",

       " (\"let me start off by saying that leading up to the release of the latest bond film , i really wasn ' t looking forward to it as much as i have with some of the previous films . i ' m not sure if it was the fairly lackluster trailers or the ever - present dread that the next film will fall back into the miserable ways of the timothy dalton years . i ' m happy to report that any doubts were erased after about the first 10 minutes of the film . by that point , it was evident that mr . bond was back with a vengeance . all doubts would have probably been erased sooner except for the fact that the first ten minutes of the film weren ' t exactly a pleasant experience . it seems that nobody told the geniuses working at the theater that the house lights are supposed to be turned off when the movie starts . it took a reminder from an audience member to clue them in . i guess they can be excused though , taking tickets and cleaning up popcorn between shows is extremely taxing on the brain . anyway , after somebody remembered what the light switch was for , i settled in for bond . i think the most noticeable aspect of this , the 19th film in the series , is that it really goes back to the almost tongue in cheek style of the roger moore films . there were probably more one - liners in this movie than in the last several combined . and bond ' s last one - liner in the film is about the best of the series . the world is not enough also contained perhaps the most action of any movie of the series . everything from wild boat chases to the usual assortment of cool bond gadgets trotted out just when there seems to be no way out for 007 . for the most part , the action sequences worked very well . although , there were a couple of times that i thought some things were a bit over the top , even for a bond film . i think some of the blame can be laid at the feet of director michael apted . while he did a good job for the most part , there were points in the movie , specifically during action sequences , that he seemed to loose site of the fact that he was making essentially an action film . most noticeably sequences on a snow covered mountain and one involving bond getting through a closing door looked like apted thought he was filming some sort of high brow art movie . he almost seemed like he didn ' t know what he was doing . but they were brief scenes and really shouldn ' t take away from the otherwise solid job that apted did in directing . if you have ever seen a bond film , you won ' t be shocked to learn that plot has never been their strong suit . the world is not enough is no exception . this time we have yet another over villain that bond has to stop for the good of the world . 007 matches wits with the terrorist renard ( robert carlyle ) , a man who has a bullet lodged in his brain that makes him impervious to pain . why this point is included is beyond me . they took great pains to explain his condition , but it only came up later in the movie as a scene that can only be described as looking like an afterthought . anyway , renard , like the typical terrorist that he is , is bent on some harebrained scheme involving a mid - east oil pipeline . i guess world domination just isn ' t as attractive to terrorists as a money making venture anymore . bond is brought in to protect the pipeline ' s owner , elektra king ( sophie marceau ) , who is the daughter of one of renard ' s recent victims . along the way , bond has to enlist the help of a nuclear scientist , dr . christmas jones ( denise richards ) , and his old rival valentin zukovsky ( robert carlyle ) . like all bond films , you basically just have to suspend disbelief over the plot , since it is ridiculous beyond words . my biggest complaint would be that it was about the most disjointed of any of the bond films . there was at least one point that i had to stop and try to remember why bond was where he was and why he was doing what he was doing . the buddy that i saw the movie with was completely confused over an earlier kidnapping of marceau ' s character . it was alluded to earlier in the movie briefly -- although not included in the film . later , it became a big part of the story and left him with the distinct feeling that he had missed something . but because it is a bond film , the beautiful women and nifty gadgets seem to make you forget about script problems quite quickly . after all , it isn ' t shakespeare . how about the cast ? brosnan seems to get better with each of his appearances as 007 . i grew up with the roger moore version of bond , so i really enjoyed the lighter style that brosnan brings to the character . judi dench , as m , had a bigger role in this film than in her two previous appearances in the role . she brought the talent with her that one would expect from an oscar winner . robbie coltrane was easily one of the best parts in goldeneye , so it was nice to see his russian mobster character revived in this movie . coltrane gets more screen time , which simply leads to him stealing even more scenes . then there are the bond girls . sophie marceau might be one of the most beautiful actresses working today . there is just something about her breathtaking eyes that makes her a natural to play the innocent victim . those that saw her in braveheart know she is more than just a pretty face . marceau may be the most talented actress to ever play a bond love interest . then we have denise richards . there was no doubt in my mind that she was cast exclusively for her looks . and after you see the outfits she wears , you won ' t have any trouble guessing what part of her anatomy caught the producer ' s eyes . i was pleasantly surprised to find that she really did a good job playing a nuclear scientist . admittedly , there was one point that the audience snickered a bit at one of her technical lines of dialogue , but other than that she stacks up ( no pun intended ) to her bond girl predecessors nicely . i must say that the biggest disappointment was robert carlyle ' s character . while carlyle did a fine job with the material that he had , his character just never worked for me . the producers tried very hard to add more complexity to his character , but it just never quite got off the ground . i guess i was hoping for a bit more regarding the whole impervious to pain aspect of his character , but the writers decided to play up the emotional side of his character . this might have worked well in another movie , but i don ' t go to see bond movies for their deep characterizations . last , but not least , we have desmond llewelyn as q . this is the 17th appearance for llewelyn as bond ' s gadget guy , and he is as good as ever . although his screen time has grown far more limited in the past few films , he is still a treat to watch . rumors abound that this may be his last appearance in the role . he says future appearances are up to a higher power . the producers have introduced his protege and future replacement , a bumbling and somewhat pompous character played by comedy master john cleese . while we don ' t see much of him in this film , i think it is fair to say that desmond llewelyn ' s legacy , whenever it is passed on , will be in very capable hands . so how does it stack up ? despite some problems , the world is not enough is a very entertaining movie . and , all things considered , what problems it does have are small compared to some that have plagued earlier bond movies . this is easily the best of the brosnan films . it may even be the best of the entire series , certainly in the top 3 . one thing is for sure , even after 19 movies , there is still plenty of life left in the james bond series . here ' s looking forward to bond number 20 .\",\n",

       " ('for those who associate italian cinema with fellini and \" high art , \" the son \\' s room is an inventive , subtle alternative . written by , directed , and starring nanni moretti , it takes us through the slow , complicated path of bereavement . slow is the best description for the film at first . it takes its time in establishing the habits of what appears to be a normal , happy family . father and mother both work but still find the time to support their son and daughter through homework and after school activities . they laugh , spend free time together , and reprimand the kids for innocent wrongs with a sigh and soft pat on the shoulder . you get the feeling there is open communication and unconditional love amongst the foursome . but suddenly , the son is found to be dead after a diving accident . the family dynamics begin an unpredictable descent that gives the narrative strength when you least expect it , but can also be trying on the attention span . though the film drags and even repeats itself , this can be somewhat excused as influenced by the process of grieving . though nanni moretti wore several hats for this production , it doesn \\' t come across as a vanity piece . one might wish he hadn \\' t picked the profession of analyst for the father , giovanni ( which he stars as ) , if only because this makes his character \\' s reactions so predictable . what saves it is a well written script , with spare dialogue and an eclectic variety of human interaction . the potency of the film lies in the recreation of the tiny details of everyday life that alter due to the death of a close relative , or that remind a depressed person of loss . you start to take notice of the cracked dishes , ignored when familial bliss was in full swing . you remember bonding during the routine jogs around the block , and not necessarily huge events like graduation . even better are the role reversals that take place within the household . while giovanni and paola ( laura morante ) do check up on their daughter irene ( jasmine trinca ) , there is a sense of being on autopilot . not only does irene begin to take care of her own needs more , she \\' ll make her parents breakfast in an attempt to crack their new shells to life around them . these scenes provide interesting portrayals of various coping mechanisms , frequently crossing a boundary as to how much you can help yourself versus others during drastic , unexpected change . respectfully , gender issues never enter the picture . self - propelled isolation is universal in terms of dealing , so moretti intelligently uses this tool to separate the family . though giovanni does stop paolo from discussing andrea at a party with friends , there is never a sense that he or she is more stoic , or more correct in the search to restore a sense of a balance to their lives . most films that broach the topic of death utilize annoying melodrama , speeches , and conciliatory issues to get the waterworks flowing . in contrast , the son \\' s room captures a more realistic depiction of the effects of death on a family by graciously flowing among the five stages of mourning ( denial , depression , anger , bargaining , acceptance ) through each of its main characters . it \\' s not the most engaging 100 minutes , but it is certainly easy to relate to .',\n",

because there is more . much , much more . and this is a movie that , without credits , is little over 90 minutes and feels only like an hour . \" the whole nine yards \" is an ultimately unsatisfying and empty - headed excursion into well - worn terrain already set by far superior pictures . how the cast , most of which are respectable actors , got caught up in such a cliched , deficient film remains a mystery , unless they thought it might aspire to match the congenial screwball zaniness of director lynn \\' s 1985 comedy classic , \" clue : the movie . \" going into the theater , preliminary comparisons between the two movies were unavoidable , but by the twenty - minute mark , when i had chuckled once and laughed nary a single time , it was clear this production was in serious trouble . since the entire running time depends on the mechanisms of the plot , and the screenplay , inauspiciously written by mitchell kapner , collapses with every failing \" comedy \" bit , the film is an inevitable dead zone in the way of substance and , frequently , entertainment value . \" the whole nine yards \" is neither facetious nor , aside from the subplot about jill \\' s shocking eagerness to become a professional hitwoman , inventive , and more often than not , just lies there , the film spinning drearily around and around in the projector , but never igniting any sort of spark . a few select actors do what they can with the material , while others make no impact at all . on the mediocre side are actually those playing the two central characters : matthew perry and bruce willis . perry , innocuously enjoyable on tv \\' s \" friends , \" plays the same exact sitcom - style character in all of his movies ( from 1997 \\' s \" fools rush in \" to 1999 \\' s \" three to tango \" ) , and it has become a crushing bore . meanwhile , willis makes next to no impression , and because of the limited guise of his jimmy \" the tulip \" tudeski , oftentimes disappears into the background . their three female counterparts fare noticeably better . best of all is natasha henstridge , far more radiant than in the exploitative \" species \" movies , who adds unanticipated depth and emotion to cynthia . henstridge has the talent , for sure , to break out of these countless throwaway roles , but first she must fire her agent . amanda peet has a lot of fun as the quirkily straightforward and giddy jill , and seems to know more about the art of comedic payoff than even perry who , thus far , has strived on a career based solely on comedy . it is too bad , then , that peet is unnecessarily asked to disrobe in a climactic scene , with the obvious sole purpose being to show off her breasts . finally , rosanna arquette is awful as sophie , but something tells me that was her purpose , and her clear overacting only aids in brightening up her limited screen time . also popping up is michael clarke duncan , fresh off an oscar nomination for his role in \" the green mile , \" as jimmy \\' s largely built friend and fellow killer , frankie figs . when \" the whole nine yards \" eventually sputters to its underwhelming conclusion , one is left pondering how such a film ever got greenlit . a great deal of movies of this type have been made in the past , and this one is nothing but a duplication of better films , so what was the point ?

       " ('hong kong cinema has been going through a bad spell . the last few productions have been effect laded action adventures that combine both the best and worst of american filmmaking with the same qualities of hong kong films . in a nutshell , the current crop of films from hong kong has been maddeningly convoluted and visually sumptuous . with the one time british colony reverting back to mainland ownership , a lot of hong kong \\' s best talents have crossed the pacific to work on u . s . productions . such talents as jackie chan ( rush hour ) , chow yun - fat ( anna & the king , the corrupter ) and yuen woo - ping ( the matrix ) have all moved into the budget bloated world of hollywood filmmaking with mixed results . now we can add two other hong kong filmmakers to the mix with star jet li and director and fight choreographer corey yuen kwai . unfortunately \" romeo must die \" bears all the trademarks of a typical hollywood action film and none of hong kong \\' s rhythms . the film opens in a nightclub as an asian couple is necking . enter a group of chinese gangsters led by kai sing ( russell wong ) . kai confronts po sing ( jon kit lee ) , the son of kai \\' s boss and leader of the local chinese family . a battle breaks out between the bodyguards of the club and kai , who handily kicks and punches his opponents down . it \\' s not until club owner silk ( rapper dmx ) , bears down on kai and his henchmen that the fight ends . the following morning po sing is found dead . suspicions escalate , as issac o \\' day ( delroy lindo ) is told of the murder . his concern that the war between his and the chinese family may explode and ruin his plans to move out of the business of corruption and into a legitimate venture . issac implores his chief of security , mac ( issiah washington ) to watch after his son and daughter . the scene shifts to a prison in china , where han sing ( jet li ) learns of his brothers murder . he fights with the guards and is dragged off to be disciplined . hung upside down by one foot , han recovers and battle his way out of custody in a blistering display of fight choreography and stunt work . escaping to the u . s . han sets out to find the person responsible for his brother \\' s death . \" romeo must die \" is in many ways a fun film . it is both absurd and assured . the basic plot of a gangster wanting to become legitimate echoes \" the godfather \" . the relationship between jet li \\' s han and aaliyah \\' s trish o \\' day reminds us of abel ferrera \\' s \" china girl \" , except that romeo must die \\' s couple never once exchange more than a loving glance towards one another . their romance is much more puritanical than any other romance in film history . the performances are adequate if not fully acceptable . li , of course has the showiest part , having to express both an innocents and steadfast determination . allayah , in her feature film debut manages to carry what little is asked of her with a certain style and grace . it \\' s obvious that the camera loves her and she is very photogenic . but , still the part is under written in such a way that even a poor performance would not have affected it . delro lindo as issac o \\' day carries himself well in the film . an unsung and under appreciated actor , mr . lindo turns out the films best performance . the other performers are all adequate in what the script asks of them except for d . b . woodside as issac \\' s son , colin . the performance is undirected , with the character changing his tone and demeanor in accordance with whatever location he is in . an unfocused performance that should have been reigned in and / or better written . first time director andrzej bartkowiak does a workmanlike job in handling the film . having a career as one of the industry \\' s best cinematographers , bartkiwiak knows how to set up his shots , and \" romeo must die \" does look good . but the pacing of the film is lethargic , only coming to a semblance of life during the fight scenes . the script by eric bernt and john jarrell is not focused in such a way that we can care about the characters or the situations they are in . the big gambit of buying up waterfront property to facilitate the building of a sports center for a nfl team is needlessly confusing . and of course the common practice of one character being the comic relief of the film becomes painfully obvious here as anthony anderson as allayah \\' s bodyguard , maurice has no comic timing whatsoever . the best things about the film are its fight scenes . jet li is a master of these intricate physical battles . one needs only to see his film \" fist of legend \" to understand that the man is without peer in the realm of martial art combat . here , jet is given the opportunity to show off in a way that \" lethal weapon 4 \" ( jet \\' s u . s . debut ) didn \\' t allow . unfortunately , a lot of jet \\' s fights are aided with computer effects that detract from his ability and precision . also \" romeo must die \" must be noted as having the most singularly useless effect ever committed to film , and that is an x - ray effect that appears three times during the course of the film , showing the effect of bone crushing blows on an opponent . obviously a homage to the famed x - ray scene from sonny chiba \\' s \" streetfighter \" , the scenes here are just pointless and interfere with the pacing of the film . it \\' s as if the film has stopped and a video game has been inserted . one problem though about the fight scenes . those that are familiar with hong kong action know that even though the films are fantasies and are as removed from reality as any anime or cartoon . they do have an internal rhythm to them . a heartbeat , so to speak in their choreography . the fight scenes in a hong kong film breath with an emotional resonance . this is created by the performance , the direction and the editing . here in \" romeo must die \" , there is no staccato . every fight scene , even though technically adroit and amazing becomes boring as the editing both cuts away from battle at hand and simple follows a set pattern . the rhythm is monotonous . a hong kong film has a tempo that changes , heightening its emotional impact . \\' rmd \\' is limited to a standard 4 / 4 tempo , not allowing for any emotional content whatsoever . a fine example of this difference can be found by examining a couple of jackie chan \\' s films . . watch the restaurant fight from the film \" rush hour \" and notice that the context of the fight , while technically amazing is rather flat ( the framing and cut always do not help ) . now look at the warehouse fight from \" rumble in the bronx \" . there you have a heartbeat , and emotional draw that doesn \\' t let the audience catch its breath . the stops and pauses for dramatic effect work perfectly , causing the viewer to be both astounded and flabbergasted . here in \\' romeo must die \\' , the fight scenes have no more emotional content or character than any john wayne barroom brawl . jet li is a grand and personable screen presence . it \\' s a shame that his full talents were not used to full effect here . one day filmmakers here in the u . s . will stop making films by the numbers and start to embrace the style and emotion that has made hong kong action pictures such a commodity . until then , we \\' ll be left with emotionally hollow product like \" the replacement killer \" and , currently \" romeo must die \" .',\n",

\" this is a question whose answer that seems to immediately conjure up the kind of movie you went to see . if the reply is julia roberts you probably assume it was something wispy and light , a sylvester stallone movie and you picture a bloodbath with few words and much involuntary bicep flexing , and a woody allen movie means hyper articulate white people ( usually of the jewish faith ) fretting about in some upper east side palace . anyway , when i answered \" john cusack \" , she replied with a rather stunned \" who ? \" , as if it was unreasonable for her to know whom i was referring to . now i know for a fact that my mother has seen several cusack movies , most recently being john malkovich and pushing tin , but i suppose it \\' s understandable that she would not recognize the name , after all , for most , names are tougher than faces . i showed her a picture of cusack \\' s mug in the paper hoping for an \" oh - him , yes he \\' s quite good \" instead i got a \" no - i don \\' t know him \" . at this point i was way beyond frustration into a realm of nose hair yanking anger ( yes , filmic ignorance is all it takes to get me into the nose hair pulling zone ) , till i realized something : i doubt that much of america would recognize cusack \\' s relatively bland visage , or even the name which is rather bland compared to the coolness of a brad pitt or tom cruise , one - syllable names that glide off the tongue with the velocity of a speeding car . cu - sack . cu - sack - no , not quite as cool . i \\' m sure that twenty years from now cusack will forever be referred to as \" the guy from ( add in the cusack film of your choice ) \" . he \\' s not a brand name , and his movies usually aren \\' t big moneymakers , but in his own unassuming way he \\' s kind of a genius . with his pleasant , common man looks , and charming semi - articulate blatherings he has become one of the most likeable romantic leading men of the 90 \\' s . from the sure thing to say anything cusack has merged the talents of early tom hanks and early jack lemmon . despite the fact that nearly every character he plays is a variation of the character before it ( the schlumpy every man ) , he \\' s a constantly enjoyable screen persona , like albert brooks or woody allen . and he knows how to chose scripts , while the stephan baldwin \\' s and val kilmer \\' s seem to put them selves in everything ( the former actually had the insight to follow up oscar winner usual suspects with a pauly shore vehicle , and judging from his latest projects it looks like he still has yet to fire his agent ) , cusack generally picks rewarding projects ( save for the unwatchable hot pursuit , a 1988 film also featuring a young ben stiller ) . high fidelity is his second collaboration with hit or miss english director stephan fears ( the grifters , the hi - lo country ) , and it \\' s a hit . it was also co - written by cusack , and some of his collaborators on the terrific comedy , grosse point blank . it \\' s not quite as entertaining or as funny as that film , but as it progresses in its meandering fashion , the movie cast something of a spell over me . high fidelity begins as a hipster ode to the non - committal rob , a vinyl record store owner , who opens the film by breaking down the fourth wall with much abandon and educating us in his \" top 5 break ups list \" . this is something cusack does the entire film a la ferris bueller \\' s day off . at first the talking - directly - into - the - camera - schtick had me vaguely annoyed , mostly because it reminded me so much of the film body shots which used a similar conceit , but it began to grow on me due almost entirely to cusack \\' s witty delivery . he \\' s the kind of guy we don \\' t mind talking directly to us . gradually the film settles into a shampoo - like tragi - comic character study , of a guy who must confront himself and his personal failures in order to figure out the true person he is ( yes it \\' s all very existential ) . though that plot - line is mostly enjoyable , the thing i liked the most about the film is how much pleasure it offers in introducing us to minor characters , all of whom ( now this is really something ) are terrific enough to warrant their own films . the best of which is jack black ( of the very funny show tenacious d , a program that sadly went the way of bruce willis \\' hair ? ? ? unfortunately that annoying smirk remains ) , an ardent record store employee who bullies customers into buying exactly what he wants them to buy . he \\' s the kind of guy i \\' m sure we \\' ve all met before , a blowhard who thinks he \\' s always right and will do anything in his power ( be it yell , argue , insult ) to hoist his opinion onto others . but i like this guy , because of how black plays him . the actor is portly with a round baby face and crazy eyes , but despite his size he leaps to and fro like a manic speed freak ( which might be a bit of a redundant description , seeing as how all the speed freaks i know are manic ) . he \\' s the kind of supporting character who would be impossibly annoying comic relief in most other films . ( look at what that hack jan de bont did to poor phillip seymour hoffman in twister ) . but fears and black never let that happen . the character , for all his shucking and jiving is steeped in reality . he \\' s over the top , but in a way we can all probably relate to . catherine zeta - jones , in her brief role , gives a vivid portrayal of a women completely enamored with her own \" charm \" . tim robbins registers in an even tinier part as a new age - type , a character played entirely for cartoon yuks , but still manages to work its desired comic effect . the one exception in the acting department is a bit of a doozy , the main love interest played by danish actress iben hjejle ( mifune ) , who completely obliterates any trace of a danish accent , replacing it with a stilted american phonation . i give her kudos for attempting such a contradictory role , but instead of being likeable , she comes across as rather robotic , and as such it \\' s hard to see why cusack \\' s character would be so obsessed with her especially when he has a beautiful , intelligent writer ( natasha gregson wagner ) potentially waiting in the wings . this reminded me of say anything , where the charming cusack was paired with the charmless ione skye , and in midnight in the garden of good and evil where the poor bastard had to put up with alison eastwood ( whose unbelievably more wooden then father , clint for those \" special people \" whose wheels turn a little slower ) . in fact cusack is rarely paired up with a personality that matches his , though i \\' d bet that if laura and natasha switched roles , the result would be more effective . high fidelity works almost entirely on the strength of its characters and performances . fears \\' direction is somewhat stilted , and the script is sometimes a little too ( and this is a word i \\' m beginning to hate to use but alas i must ) quirky for its own good ( i think i \\' ll blame that on scott rosenberg , who judging from what he did with beautiful girls , con air , and things to do in denver while your dead , has his fingerprints all over the most irritating bits of this movie ) . but cusack really does deserve an award , for being so damn ? ? ? cusackian . i \\' m afraid that his talents are so understated that he may have to wait till his hip needs replacing to be offered such an award worthy of his considerable talent . his character , rob ( whose sort of like an older , more bitter lloyd from say anything ) is funny and tragic without being pathetic , and that cusack can do all this , and still not imprint himself onto the minds of most audiences , is something of an achievement .',\n",

       " (\"apparently , director tony kaye had a major battle with new line regarding his new film , american history x . i don ' t know the details of the fight , but it seems that he is not happy with the final product , and nearly removed his name from the credits altogether . i ' ve heard about this kind of thing happening before , and it makes me wonder how much input a studio has over the films they produce . as it is , i found american history x to be an extremely good film , not just because of tony kaye ' s focused look at the touchy subject of racism , but because of a powerful , charismatic performance from edward norton . it ' s hard to believe that it has only been two years since norton ' s fantastic role in primal fear , but , here he is now , starring in his own film and making himself a star . norton is one of those performers who becomes his character , and his work in american history x is one of the very best performances this year . he plays a young man named derek vinyard , a skinhead living in venice beach with his brother , danny ( edward furlong ) , mother ( beverly d ' angelo ) , and sister , davin ( jennifer lien ) . the film opens with a flashback , in which derek brutally kills two black men vandalizing his car . we find out that this lands him in prison , and the film from that point is seen through the eyes of danny . in the present - time of the film , danny is in high school , and eager to follow the footsteps of his brother . much of the film is told in flashback , and we see the path that leads to derek ' s adoption of white supremacy . when derek is released , having served three years in prison , he finds that his brother is now a full - blown skinhead ; derek , however , has given up the violence , and tries to get his brother to understand why racism and the violence that comes with it are bad things . what makes this all interesting is that these two young men are not stupid , thoughtless people -- they are intelligent and articulate , and voice their beliefs in disturbingly straightforward terms . it ' s hard to make a controversial movie and not preach , but kaye has found the right note for his material . because american history x is a mainstream film , there has to be a redemption phase for our main character -- some people may think that this is the only way to make him sympathetic . i partially disagree with this , because , although i do not advocate racism in any way , it ' s interesting the way kaye presents derek -- he is a loud , obnoxious man , but he ' s also very smart . the reasons for why he becomes a skinhead are believable -- his father was arbitrarily killed by a group of black men . it ' s clear that he ' s passionate about his beliefs , and that he ' s not just a punk looking for an excuse to beat people up . of course , it helps that kaye has an actor as talented as norton to play this part . it ' s astonishing how frightening norton looks with a shaved head and a swastika on his chest . in addition to getting the look just right , he ' s perfect for this role -- derek requires intelligence , depth , and a whole lot of shouting , and norton does it all with ease . even when he ' s at his meanest , derek has a likable quality to him , and that ' s a gutsy approach when telling a story about a skinhead . what adds depth to the story is a subplot in which the principal of danny ' s school ( avery brooks ) becomes obsessed with purging the hatred from danny . the other performances are all terrific , with standouts from furlong , d ' angelo , and lien . visually , the film is very powerful . kaye indulges in a lot of interesting artistic choices , and most of them work nicely -- lots of slow - motion and strange camera angles add to a moody atmosphere . but , like a lot of movies lately , american history x skims past greatness in the last few minutes . although the climactic scene is very moving , the picture ends with a pretentious , preachy resolution featuring a brief narration from a character who was killed . for a movie so smart a subtle up until that point , it felt like a slap in the face to be hand - fed a theme in such a simplistic way . it makes me wonder what , exactly , tony kaye disliked about the final version of his film . perhaps this last scene was the problem . it ' s hard to imagine any director not being at least partially pleased with a film this good -- in a time when so many movies are timid and weak , american history x manages to make a compelling argument for racism without advocating it any way .\",\n",

       " ('recently i read 4 reviews of pleasantville - one from entertainment weekly , one from a newsgroup , and two from different online resources . each review compared this film to the truman show . why ? the only reason people compared pleasantville to truman is due to the fact that their lives are on television . other than that , the two movies are completely different from each other . reviewers seem to love to pick one movie ( i . e . the truman show ) , obsess over it , and make it a guideline for other movies . when pleasantville and edtv opened , all critics seemed to treat the two films like they were subjects of king truman . the same goes for the thin red line , as well . when it opened in decemeber , probably 98 % of reviews compared it to stephen spielberg \\' s saving private ryan , giving thin line no chance whatsoever . critics loved private ryan so much , that they automatically decided no movie is good enough to reach its standards . this is why i think pleasantville was underrated . if the truman show had never been made , pleasantville probably would have received better reviews , done better at the box office , and would be remembered after it \\' s long been on the video store shelves . sure , it wasn \\' t perfect , and it wasn \\' t very believeable , but neither was the wizard of oz or star wars , and there stands two of the most prominent movies in history . with the exception of don knotts as the annoying \" tv repairman \" the film is cast perfectly : the ice storm \\' s tobey maguire is david in real life ; he watches the old 50 \\' s sitcom \" pleasantville \" to escape from his feuding parents . his twin sister , jen ( reese witherspoon ) is a popular slut who ( steriotypically ) smokes and wears revealing clothes . but what makes her character believeable is the dialogue - those excessive 90 \\' s terms such as \" like \" , \" whatever \" , and \" cool \" make her sound like the total dimwit she \\' s supposed to be . the twins , with a little help from a tv repairman ( casting don knotts in this role was obviously a cameo - esque cast rather than a true acting one ) , are sucked into pleasantville by a magical new remote . their new parents , played by william h . macy and joan allen , are perfect in every way . their new names are bud and mary sue , and right away they start to corrupt the town of pleasantville . after the siblings fit comfortably in their new roles , the movie begins to take form . it \\' s just like watching a sitcom in itself ; you don \\' t want it to end . \" mary sue \" has sex with her date , the school basketball champion ; when he tells all his friends about it , they stop preforming perfectly at basketball , and things start to take color . soon we learn that these people don \\' t know how to express true emotions , and when they learn to do so , they eventually turn into color . this eventually sparks a racial war between the \" coloreds \" and the \" black & whites . \" entertainment weekly reviewer lisa schwarzbaum claims the movie has , \" none of the depth , poignance , and brilliance of the truman show . . . \" yes , the truman show was maybe a little more intelligent . but the racial setting - intensified by the forcing of the coloreds to sit in the upper box of the courtroom - certainly classifies as deep , considering it \\' s what i least expected . gary ross did not try to create an intelligent , award masterpiece - he just tries to convey moral messages within his work . take for example big and dave , his past films . big - be careful what you wish for . dave - good or bad lying is still lying . did these movies win big awards ? no , but they won the heart of millions . pleasantville could have done that too , if it wasn \\' t for snotty reviewers who set precedents with preceeding films . pleasantville : a - ad2am \" i almost lost my nose . . . and i like it . i like breathing through it . \" - jack nicholson , chinatown',\n",

one should start each day considering oneself as dead . living atop an abandoned building , surrounded by his flock of pet carrier pigeons , ghost dog exists in a netherworld lacking creature comforts and friends . he craves nothing more . as he puts it late in the film , \" i \\' ve seen all i want to see . \" he exists in a spiritual world of the mind , gaining moral sustenance from his readings . ghost dog wasn \\' t always as he is presented . in several roshomon - like flashbacks , it \\' s shown how ghost dog was assaulted by racist white males and beaten nearly to death until the timely intervention of a good samaritan , that \" samaritan \" being a foot soldier in an aging crime family . ghost dog pledges his life to the service of the man , louie ( tormey ) , as repayment . after years of loyal service , ghost dog is sent , by louie , to kill \" handsome frank \" , a made man within louie \\' s organization who has run away with the crime boss \\' s daughter , louise ( vessey ) . ghost dog wordlessly executes his task , witnessed by louise , whom he spares , as she sits watching a betty boop cartoon , clutching a copy of the book , roshomon . in a bit of synchronicity , louise loans the book to ghost dog . upset that frank was taken out by someone not from the family , the mob bosses , in turn , put out a hit on ghost dog in a perverse twist of loyalty to their assassinated comrade . the rest of movie holds the dated value systems of both the mafia and ghost dog up to the light of a new millennium with many acerbic asides as the two come factions come into conflict . the theme of old cartoons flares up time and again , each time showing cartoon violence that is in sharp counterpoint to the reality of ghost dog \\' s world . each time a character is shown watching a cartoon , it \\' s from the same era , betty boop , felix the cat , etc . , a reflection of days gone by . near the end , louise is watching a cartoon that \\' s a departure from the previously shown ones . it \\' s a bit of audacity on jarmusch \\' s part that is nicely effective , despite it \\' s surrealistic nature . as ghost dog floats through his world , his life is touched by two people . one is a sage little girl ( winbush ) who connects with ghost dog through their love of reading . she comes to symbolize a melding of the old ways and new sensibilities , just as louise ultimately does . by film \\' s end , the fact that jamusch is so effective at illustrating the tenuous bond between the two is a testament to his skill as a writer . the other person in ghost dog \\' s world is an ice cream ( de bankole \\' ) vendor who only speaks french , yet intuitively shares a rapport with ghost dog . the vendor is the literal stranger in a strange land . jarmusch , through rapper / composer rza , underscores his film with rap and reggae music , which at first blush seems dichotomous , but its primal rhythms serve to strengthen the fundamental nature of the movie . ghost dog seems to draw some type of strength from the rap music he listens to as he negotiates the streets in various stolen cars . ( which , in and of itself , presents another paradox about ghost \\' s dog \\' s sense of honor . ) the head mafioso is played by henry silva with a stone faced resignation . of all the cartoonish mobsters , he is the only one who appears self aware of his state in the world . gorman plays sonny , a lieutenant who respects the old ways , yet has a quirky affinity for rap music , a love comically shown in several impromptu displays . ruffini seems the truest reflection of the mafia . he is a husk of a man , assisted by two hearing aids , who barks out advice without truly hearing what he , or others are saying . whitaker carries the film by using what truly great actor \\' s use , his face . ghost dog is reticent to speak , often going for long periods without doing so . the fact that whitaker can convey such a wide range of emotion through a gesture or look is a remarkable talent . although the film has a deliberate pace , some of the late night drives and walks taken by ghost dog dragged the momentum down . truly tragic is how ghost dog misinterprets japanese honor in his final confrontation with the mob . he reveals himself to be so desperate for spiritual guidance through the hagakure that he fails to truly adapt it to what is real and true in his world . carried on the shoulders of a remarkable performance by whitaker , ghost dog rises beyond being a characterization or icon , into a figure that garners sympathy , if not a bit of pity .',\n",

other than director russ meyer \\' s predilection for casting attractive large breasted women who ultimately expose the afore - mentioned anatomical areas , there is really only one other reason to recommend even taking a look at this movie . that is the fact that it was co - written by famed film critic roger ebert , who also was responsible for the screenplay . after watching this movie you will never be able to sit through another one of his reviews where he gives a movie a thumbs down for bad writing with a straight face . this movie stinks out loud . quite frankly , this movie deserves a . but there are parts of it that are so bad they are almost funny . so i \\' m giving it a . and maybe that is too generous . right from the opening credits , i knew that i had a class - a bomb on my hands . not only are the way the credits actually shot distracting , but the first scene you see includes a big breasted young woman being chased by a guy in a nazi uniform . i had absolutely no idea why the hell that was happening ( it does get explained later ) and as soon as the first scene is over , we cut to a completely unrelated scene . to be honest , as i sat through this movie mesmerized by just how incredibly awful it was , i actually forgot about the seemingly out of place opening until it popped up again later in the film . with the quality of the writing during the rest of the film , it wouldn \\' t have surprised me if the opening had never been explained . so what is this movie about ? you ask . like it really matters . ok , here goes . this all - girl band headed by kelly macnamara ( dolly reed ) and her friends go to hollywood to try to gain a foothold in the music industry . once there , they do manage to find success ( due as much to their hooters as anything else ? it sure wasn \\' t for their brutally bad singing voices ) , and the movie chronicles how their lives change for the worse as the pressures of fame get to them . everything from big egos , to booze and drugs to free flowing sex sends them on a downward spiral . there are a couple of other idiotic subplots thrown in for good measure , but the fame is the one that pretty much sums up this thing . > from a creative standpoint there is nothing redeeming here . other than the above - mentioned obsession with big knockers that russ meyer seemed to have . the dialogue is so incredibly bad that it literally is funny in parts . mr . ebert has generously thrown in helpings of \" hey man \" , \" dig \" and my all time favorite -- \" this is my happening , and it freaks me out \" . now i ask you , with lines like that how can you go wrong ? ebert had tried to inject as many big words as possible into the dialogue . maybe he thought it would make the movie seem smarter . i don \\' t know , but all the big words in the world wouldn \\' t be able to disguise the bad writing and even worse acting . but the wretched dialogue goes along well with the wretched quality of everything else in this movie . i \\' ve seen home movies directed better than meyer managed with this turkey . in fact , there is one scene -- the one in which they are in a van driving to hollywood to make their fortunes -- during which i really had to question if meyer or his editors had just suffered serious head injuries . add to the directing and writing the music in this movie . i almost got up to check my sound system to see if it was broken , there was such a pile of crap emanating from the speakers . then we have the cast . first lets start david gurian who played harris , the manager of the band . this has got to be the goofiest looking guy that has ever set foot in front of a motion picture camera . sadly , his acting doesn \\' t come close to making up for his looks . if you have been following along up to this point , this shouldn \\' t surprise you . meyer \\' s stable of well endowed girls also have the benefit of being fairly attractive to go along with their other assets . dolly reed plays kelly , the leader of the band . and no surprise here , she was cast for her cup size , not her talents . and yes , she does loose the shirt a few times and display her impressive talents . sadly , her ass is almost as large as her chest . hey , it a sexist movie , so i \\' m writing a sexist review . then we have former playboy playmate cynthia myers in a fairly small role as casey , one of the other band members . this goes along with the rest of the idiotic thinking in the movie . meyer casts a gorgeous playmate with a rack to kill for and who obviously has no acting talent at all , but her nude scenes are the biggest disappointment of all . sure russ , now is the time to get artsy and throw in some well placed shadows . on the up side , she does have a fun lesbo scene . i sound like i \\' m writing a review in a porn magazine . but hey , i \\' ll admit it ; the only reason that i actually managed to sit through this damn movie was to catch a look at cynthia myers naked . and since that was a huge disappointment , i pretty much wasted two hours of my life on this turkey . the only thing that i can say about this movie is that you should stay away from it . unless of course you want to feel good about yourself by knowing that even a pulitzer prize winning film critic like roger ebert has screwed up at least once in his life too . and if you are thinking of checking it out for the double d \\' s -- you are better off just downloading nude cynthia myers pictures off the internet . this is a movie that should be avoided at all costs . an even better idea might be to require video stores to place a warning on the box of beyond the valley of the dolls -- beware : this movie is extremely hazardous to your common sense . proceed with extreme caution .',\n",

       " ('there is a scene in patch adams in which patch is in the center of a courtroom , surrounded by people who are giving him a lively standing ovation because of his strong - worded attack on a group of stoic doctors . when i noticed that the audience with whom i saw this film was reacting the same way , i realized that i was going to have a hard time finding someone who agrees with me about the quality of the picture . you see , patch adams revolted me beyond all boundaries . i hated this movie for every second that i sat watching it , and i actively hate it now , days later , with the simpering , superficial , nauseatingly sentimental images forever plaguing my memories . i hate every element of the film , beginning with tom shadyac \\' s shameless direction , and all the way up to the misguided and mishandled themes that the screenplay wants so desperately to convey . the badness of patch adams is stupefying . it \\' s confounding . i can \\' t believe a film can be this bad . and yet , it \\' s based on a real man who probably has a good point to make . in the film , patch is played by the undefeatable and indefatigable robin williams , in a performance of such insulting pathos and sledgehammer sympathy that i wonder now if he is even human . in the beginning of the film , patch commits himself to a mental institution because he doesn \\' t want to kill himself . while there , he notices that the doctors don \\' t care about the patients , and that the best way to get through to the patients is to treat them like human beings . so , patch goes on a crusade to be a great doctor who actually talks to his patients . he goes to medical school , where he meets truman ( daniel london ) and convinces him that it \\' s good to help people . he also meets carin fischer ( monica potters ) , the anti - male med student who just wants to go through the motions and be a successful doctor . naturally , the dean of the medical school ( bob gunton ) hates patch , and wants to thwart his plans , even though patch gets the highest scores on all of his exams . so patch decides that he \\' s going to build a free clinic in the middle of nowhere to help people with any problem they may have . and that , my friends , is the synopsis for what is easily the most abhorrent picture of 1998 . on a superficial level , the film is not particularly bad : i wouldn \\' t say the cinematography bothered me , and most of the performances seem to be exactly what shadyac was aiming for ( i actually liked potter \\' s performance , even if she is wasted ) . but the film fails fundamentally in execution . every scene swells with grand , \" emotional \" music , played at maximum volume just to get us all to cry real hard . take , for instance , the first scene , which shows patch sitting on a bus . we don \\' t know patch yet , but there \\' s sad music , and it \\' s supposed to make us really sad that he \\' s sad . later on , patch makes a lot of progress : he helps a dying patient ( peter coyote ) to enjoy the last days of his life , and the music as patch is pushing the patient recklessly through the halls of the hospital is very lively . and when that patient finally dies ( spoiler alert ! ) , the music is very very sad . but the problem with all of this is that the music should not be the center of the emotions . real drama is character - based . you grow to like someone , and then something bad happens , and you feel it . we don \\' t ever grow to know the dying patient ; he \\' s simply a vehicle for patch \\' s greatness . real drama doesn \\' t seem forced , or present just to make the audience cry . that \\' s why patch adams is not real drama . it goes for every cheap tear imaginable , wringing tired and overbearing sentimentality out of every scene . even scenes that have very little impact on the overall film are drowning in marc shaiman \\' s sickening musical score . sentimentality like this is indeed bad . but it \\' s not as bad as half - baked , simplistic themes . you see , patch is a really great student . he aces his tests without studying , and does it so effectively that people think he \\' s cheating . but patch doesn \\' t think that memorizing facts is the way to become a good doctor . \" why don \\' t we see patients until the third year ? \" he bursts out every three seconds . well , patch , that might have something to do with the fact that you need to learn something before you go treating patients . not everyone has the capability of memorizing facts with no effort . most of us have to study . and a doctor who really wants to help , but doesn \\' t know a toe from a finger , probably won \\' t be too successful in preventing death . oh wait , i almost forgot : the point of doctors is not just to \" prevent death , \" but to \" improve the quality of life ! \" yes ! that is true ! and you can not do that without studying . you can not do that without going to medical school . what patch never seemed to understand was the possibility that maybe , just maybe , it is a good idea to study first and talk to patients later . follow the rules ? bah ! who needs the rules ! only uptight doctors follow the rules . the real saviors are the ones running around the hospitals with big red spheres on their faces and sporting baggy yellow pants . and then there \\' s the free clinic issue , which i find shockingly , frighteningly idealistic . a free clinic . in the middle of the forest . where patients can be taken to be helped . for free . how will patients be transported to the free clinic ? will it have an emergency room ? or is it just for mental patients ? and who , may i ask , will pay for it ? the film does give some token attempts to question patch \\' s motives ( i think another character asks him how he \\' s going to pay for it , in addition to a little bit of meaningless blather about hmos and medical insurance ) , but they certainly don \\' t explore or challenge patch \\' s ideas to any meaningful extent . reader , please understand this : i am not making any kind of judgment on the real patch adams . i know nothing about him . if his beliefs mirror those of this film character , then i might like to have an intelligent discussion with him about them . but regardless of what the real patch adams believes , the themes put forth in this film are simplistic and phony . and in the last scene , the big , obligatory courtroom scene that forced my lunch halfway up my esophagus , patch does a lot of shouting . actually , robin williams does a lot of shouting . he shouts a lot about helping people , and a lot of people cry because they are moved by his words . i won \\' t tell you that you can \\' t be moved by his words , because i , too , was moved by his words . i was moved in such a profoundly negative way that i was reminded of how cheap and phony a cinematic experience can be . patch adams is the cheapest of them all .',\n",

       " ('young einstein is embarrassingly lame , but that didn \\' t stop it from becoming a phenomenon in australia , where it became the third largest box office hit of all time . in the u . s . , warner brothers is hoping the movie will follow in the footsteps of paul hogan , inxs , and shrimp on the barby to become the latest rage from down under . personally , i \\' m hoping americans everywhere will rise to the occasion and make young einstein a box office bomb . young einstein sprang from the twisted mind of yahoo serious , who not only wrote , produced , edited , and directed the film , but also starred and did his own stunts . his creation is about as stupid and contrived as you \\' d expect from someone named yahoo . the movie takes substantial historical liberties in recreating einstein \\' s youth . whereas the scientist actually hailed from germany , the film finds him still living with his parents on tasmania , a remote australian island . in addition to deriving the formula for energy and the theory of relativity , albert invents surfing , bubbles in beer , and the electric guitar . yahoo plays einstein as a naive and unrefined country hick -- a clown with an insatiable curiosity . although yahoo \\' s performance is at first endearing , the one - dimensional characterization loses its novelty faster than you can say e = mc2 . yahoo has created a charming family for albert , and the scenes on tasmania are often clever . but after the first twenty minutes , the movie quickly plummets and degenerates into a poor excuse for a comedy . young einstein is hampered by its lethargic pace and inane plot . yahoo must be an mtv addict because his movie features an omnipresent soundtrack ; unfortunately , the music is altogether gratuitous and quickly becomes overbearing . almost every other scene includes a blaring rock song that leaves you wondering whether you are watching a movie or a music video . the instrumental score , on the other hand , is generally playful ; yahoo uses such classics as the \" 1812 overture \" and the theme from the good , the bad and the ugly to great comic effect . halfway through young einstein , i knew for sure the movie was a stinker . but it wasn \\' t until the very end that i finally put my finger on why : the comedy takes its roots not from whimsical film fantasies ( such as young sherlock holmes ) but from cheesy prime - time sitcoms . in fact , young einstein might have been more at home on network television , where its sophomoric humor wouldn \\' t raise any eyebrows .',\n",

       " ('contact is a nobly intentioned but ultimately unsatisfying adaptation of carl sagan \\' s only novel . it details the circumstances surrounding the first clear sign of intelligent life in outer space and their effects on the life of a young and idealistic radio astronomer named ellie arroway ( jodie foster ) . we first meet ellie at a giant radio telescope in puerto rico , where she is part of the seti ( search for extraterrestrial intelligence ) project . her research is quickly killed , however , by her highly political david drumlin ( tom skerrit ) , who disdains \" pure research \" in favor of science with \" commercial applications . she goes in search of private funding and is turned down at every step until she pitches her project to a corporation run by the mysterious s . r . hadden ( john hurt ) . then , with that money just about to finally dry up , ellie is sitting out in the desert near the very large array in new mexico when she hears over her headphones a very powerful pulsing radio signal . in the movie \\' s most exciting and believable sequence , ellie and her coworkers determine that the signal has to be coming from the star vega . at first the signal appears to be just sequences of prime numbers , then it turns out to be a tv signal of the berlin olympics bounced back to earth from 50 years before . further decoding , with hadden \\' s help , reveals another layer to message , containing detailed plans for a massive and complex machine . it appears that the machine is a transport that will allow one person to travel to the aliens \\' home world . of course , the big question becomes \" who gets to ride it ? \" ( right after \" who \\' s gonna pay for this thing ? \" ) . to boil it down , ellie gets denied the seat in the machine because she bluntly acknowledges her atheism , while drumlin gets to go because he rather insincerely professes his deep religious faith . drumlin is killed and the machine destroyed when religious fanatics bomb the launch platform ( apparently to keep \" godless science \" from talking to god , or something like that ) . then hadden reappears with startling news . he has secretly constructed a second machine off the coast of japan and has reserved the ride for ellie , in whom he has taken a rather paternal interest . ellie boards the machine and is transported through some kind of wormhole to a dream - like place that looks a lot like waikiki beach before they built the hotels , where she meets the aliens who take the form of her late father ( david morse ) . when she returns home , no one believes her . she was not even gone for one second , they say , even though she remembers being gone for 18 hours . her story is officially discredited , although believed by a large segment of the public ( who don \\' t even have to know that her computer records of the trip contain nothing but static . . . eighteen hours worth of static ) . there is a lot to like about contact so i will highlight those points first . ellie arroway is a well - rounded character portrayed by one of the best actresses currently working . neither the character nor the performance has the same depth as clarice starling in silence of the lambs , but that \\' s a tough standard to meet . ellie is interesting in that she is woman defined by a strange array of father figures . her real father is an idealized movie dad who does nothing in the film but love his daughter unconditionally . drumlin comes across as a distant stepfather to whom ellie is like an irritating teenager who wants to use his toys to get into trouble . hadden obviously has affection for ellie , but in the end he seems to see her as his creation , nothing more than his favorite piece on the chess board . even palmer joss ( matthew mcconaughey ) , ellie \\' s love interest , takes a paternalistic interest in ellie , seeing her as a misguided person who needs protection from her own impulses . the film is technically impressive , especially in the scenes where the message is first received and during the destruction of the first machine . the part of the film dealing with the message has the best presentation of real science in a film since the andromeda strain . the film falls apart when dealing with its central theme , the dichotomy between science and religion . this is a very real debate but contact boils it down to a simplistic level that never really touches on the actual issues involved . the film presents science pretty well ( until the end ) so the real problem stems from it presentation of religious faith . religious people are presented as shallow caricatures . rob lowe plays a ralph reed clone named richard rank ( very subtle , guys ) , the voice of the religious right . another religious figure is the fanatic who blows up the first machine ( jake busey ) . the only really fleshed - out religious person , palmer joss , is supposed to be a minister of some sort , but his actual faith is left pretty vague . i can \\' t even say for certain that he was supposed to be a christian . all we know is that he dropped out of the seminary and obviously has no qualms about pre - marital sex . the film drops the science ball at the very end , when ellie appears to assert that there are some things even scientists must take on faith . in a day and age when the theory of evolution is denounced by the religion right as an atheist \" religious \" doctrine , this is exactly the wrong message to send . in a movie dealing with issues of science and faith , the last thing you want your scientist character to do is abandon the principle of scientific skepticism . what ellie should have said was , \" you shouldn \\' t believe me . not without evidence , and i don \\' t have the evidence . i know what happened but you shouldn \\' t take my word alone . \" that is the voice of science speaking . the character of david drumlin is another problem with this film . his attitudes toward pure research project seem out of place for a person in his position . also , his profession of \" faith \" before the selection committee is so nakedly and transparently insincere that only a pack of idiots should have fallen for it . the last big problem is with the use of real personalities in various roles . the media figures , such as bernard shaw and jay leno aren \\' t so bad , in as much as their participation was voluntary . the use of bill clinton , however , should give anyone pause . first of all , lifting the image of a sitting head of state and inserting him into a fictional story line , thus using his words outside of the context in which they were spoken , is just plain creepy . also , using the real president places this film between 1993 and 2001 , forever dating it . people watching this film in the future will say , \" hey , this never took place during clinton \\' s term . \" this bit of unreality will jar people out of their suspension of disbelief . also , the level of technology portrayed in the film is too advanced to take place before the first decade of the next century . better to have had a fictitious president played by an actor or no president at all . the film does raise an interesting question , although it never develops it in a satisfying way . if we were picking an emissary to send to an alien culture , would an atheist be automatically disqualified just because ninety percent of the population of the world professes a belief in god , or at least some form of supernatural creator ? personally , i would hope not , since religion is basically an opinion , a form of ideology . i would not want any form of ideological test for such an import task .',\n",

       " (\"this is the kind of movie that makes one appreciate disney ' s live - action george of the jungle . tarzan and the lost city , the latest attempt to bring edgar rice burrough ' s legendary hero to the big screen , is one of the most inept and ill - timed of any tarzan adventure so far . badly conceived and poorly executed , tarzan and the lost city appears headed for a quick trip to video store shelves . i have no idea why the producers chose now to bring back tarzan ; it ' s not as if there are legions of new fans clamoring for his next movie . furthermore , it ' s even more curious that this film is rated pg , which , by definition , rules out any sex or explicit violence . and , while i ' m not advocating the excesses embraced by the 1981 bo derek version of the story , tarzan deserves a slightly more adult approach than the one used in the embarrassing production . of course , no tweaking of the content to change the rating could have saved tarzan and the lost city , since the film ' s troubles originated with the script and were propagated all the way down the line . imagine george of the jungle stripped of all ( intentional ) humor , and you have a fair idea of what this tarzan is like . with its uninspired action and tepid adventure sequences , the film barely registers a pulse . anyone in search of a relatively entertaining , family jungle adventure should check out the 1994 version of the jungle book , which uses the same basic elements to much better effect . the only worthwhile element of tarzan and the lost city is the pretty scenery ( which , unfortunately , includes the two lead actors ) . the film doesn ' t attempt to re - tell the origin story ? the thinking is that it has been done often enough . instead , tarzan and the lost city introduces us to lord graystoke a . k . a . john clayton a . k . a . tarzan the ape man ( casper van dien ) several days before his marriage to lady jane porter ( jane march ) . he is living happily in england , enjoying the benefits of being a land - owning noble . meanwhile , in central africa , the dastardly nigel ravens ( steven waddington ) , a self - proclaimed scholar and explorer , believes he has found the way to the lost city of opar , which he calls the cradle of civilization . on the way there , he and his band of mercenaries do all sorts of nasty things , like burning native villages , to earn the wrath of the locals . one shaman , determined to stop ravens from unearthing opal , sends a mystical message to tarzan for help . with lady jane following close behind , he returns to the jungle where he was born . its patently obvious that casper van dien ( one of the pretty - boy heroes of starship troopers ) was not hired on the basis of his acting ability . with his plastic facial expressions , monotone voice , and complete inability to make convincing animal noises , his range rivals that of steven seagal . his pecs , however , are impressive , and director carl schenkel makes sure that he is given every opportunity to show them off . jane march , on the other hand , has to keep her shirt on , which may be a first for her . some six years ago , march give a solid performance in jean jacques annaud ' s steamy the lover . since then , she made the career - killing decision of appearing opposite bruce willis in the color of night , which exploited her every acting defiency . tarzan continues this trend . march may be attractive , but , at least judging by this performance , she can ' t act . meanwhile , steven waddington has serious trouble summoning up the menace necessary to be a really detestable bad guy . instead , he turns out to be little more than a nuisance . the story line is pure formula , which has largely been true throughout the years for almost all of the tarzan movies . the problem is that this one seems so childish and lifeless . the romantic elements are all contrived ? in fact , lady jane ' s presence is necessary only so she can be captured and subsequently rescued by her buff fiance . the special effects are truly bottom - of - the - barrel ( including some laughably bad men in ape costumes ? apparently , animatronics were too expensive for this production ) . and , of course , as with all jungle movies , there are the obligatory cute animals . over the years , the legend of tarzan has been one of the most popular sources for film series material . the most famous ape man was johnny weismuller , but no less than two dozen other actors have essayed the part ( including gordon scott , who is widely believed to be the best actor to tackle the role ) . weismuller made 12 tarzan features ; van dien will probably fall 11 short of that number . and , having seen tarzan and the lost city , i would argue that the movie - going public would have been well served if he had missed by 12 .\",\n",

       " (\"synopsis : in this movie , steven spielberg , one of today ' s finest directors , attempts to spice up the 1800s story of a long courtroom battle over the fate of prisoner cinque ( djimon hounsou ) - - a young angry man from sierra leone who was kidnapped into slavery - - and his fellow prisoners . cinque and friends have landed a ship on the shores of america after escaping spanish slave traders , but since the americans don ' t speak cinque ' s language , the black men are hauled into court to determine whether or not they are legally slaves . technically , since the international slave trade was outlawed at that time , people like cinque couldn ' t be kidnapped into slavery ; one had to be born a slave to be legally considered a slave . lawyers baldwin and adams ( matthew mcconaughey and anthony hopkins ) must prove cinque and the others were captured into slavery , rather than born slaves , in order to get them out of prison as free men . three lengthy court cases are portrayed with spielberg ' s trademark panache - - flashy beginning , lots of facial close - ups , big music , and dramatic imagery . a final speech by adams is followed by an anticlimax where subtitles show what eventually happened to the various characters . opinion : making a fictional movie is easier than making one about real life . in fiction , one invents purposeful , clear - cut good guys and bad guys , puts the fictional characters in conflict , and takes the tale to its exciting conclusion . real life , however , consists of long stretches of boredom with a few dramatic moments and characters who stand around , think thoughts and do nothing , or come and go before events are resolved . spielberg gives us a visually spicy and historically accurate real life story . djimon hounsou and anthony hopkins turn in excellent performances .\",\n",

       " ('i have to admit that i disliked this film initially . it certianly isn \\' t for every taste , and it \\' s sheer torture to sit through if you \\' re in a restless mood . that said , if you are in the right mood , it \\' s absolutely incredible . this was my second favorite movie of 1998 , and would have been a shoo - in for first in almost any other year . perhaps the big turn - off for many was this film \\' s unconventionality . i \\' d be hard - pressed to compare it to any other film that i \\' ve seen - it is very , very artsy , incredibly slow - and amazingly , it works beautifully . on my second viewing , i realized that the film follows the three act structure ( i didn \\' t think it had any sort of structure at all when i first saw it ) . the first act serves to set up the characters - sort of . it exists even moreso to set a mood of tension and restlesness , and perhaps even feelings of boredom . and then it is shattered by the intense violence of the second ( which encompasses most of the movie ) . the majority of the film is one extended battle scene , intercut with brief flashbacks and voice - overs . the artsier elements do not detract from the action , but add to it - they succeed in briefly letting the viewer peek into the minds of the soldiers , only to be suddenly yanked back into reality when the battle resumes . the battle scenes are amazing ( second only to \" saving private ryan \" in my opinion ) . they \\' re brutal , horrifying , and at times beautiful due to the amazing cinematography . the second act is as immersive , brilliant , and haunting as any film that i have ever seen . the only problems come during the first and third acts . malick takes a little too long to get the film started . although the initial scenes - which consist of two soldiers \\' experiencing a near - eden - like paradise while going awol , and the preperations for battle - are effective and necessary , hints of pretentiousness sink in . the film is just a tad too artsy near the beginning , and a lot of people that disliked the movie probably gave up on it because of this . the final act is effective at winding the film down , but the problems from the first persist - it \\' s a bit too long , and comes over as pretentious at times . that said , there are two sequences ( one where a soldier gets a devastating note from his wife , and another where one of the main characters is killed ) that are nothing short of incredible . the performances are phenominal all around . the two standouts are nick nolte and newcomer jim caviezel , both of whom should have been nominated for oscars . nolte is riveting and intense as the colonel in charge of the operation . his character is hard , mean , and somewhat reckless with the lives of his men , and yet nolte somehow manages to evoke sympathy for him . caviezel is forever questioning the nature of war , his place in it , and if there \\' s any deeper meaning to the hell that he \\' s going through . he is absolutely perfect - genuine , sympathetic , sincere , and yet strong when he needs to be . although restricted to a relatively small role , sean penn is also very good as the company \\' s pessimistic seargent . as to how it stacks up to \" saving private ryan \" - it was my second favorite movie of 1998 , \" ryan \" was my first . it \\' s really hard to compare the two - they are so , so different - so i won \\' t , beyond saying that spielberg \\' s film had more of an impact on me . however , the two are comparable from the standpoint of quality ( i can easily see why someone would \" the thin red line \" above \" ryan ) . i highly recommend both of them , and consider them to be the two best war movies ever made . all in all , \" the thin red line \" is filmmaking of an incredibly high order . it \\' s slight faults are easily offset by the sheer brilliance of what is done right . it \\' s a real shame that it tanked at the box office - films this unconventional , powerful , and thought - provoking don \\' t come along very often .',\n",

! ? ) , comes off as stoic , stilted and caricatured ( it appears as though she was a vulcan geisha in a former life ) . and obi - wan , although mcgregor makes him very endearing , has so little screen time that he \\' s nothing but a robin to qui - gon jinn \\' s batman . however , mcgregor does struggle manfully to infuse this surprisingly small supporting role with a spark of genuine insight and humanity , and he does a good job . he also absolutely nails alec guiness \\' ( obi - wan in episode 4 - 6 ) scottish accent , and that really makes his presence in the film more profound than it might have been otherwise . in fact , lucas seems to bank on that preexisting knowledge quite a bit , and that \\' s one of the problems with this film . i would never call myself a \" star wars \" fan - especially not considering what it means to be a fanatic these days - but i \\' ve always enjoyed the films along with everyone else in america . however , if you are the one person in america who * hasn \\' t * seen the films at all or even recently , or who doesn \\' t bother to brush - up on the names of obscure characters , you may be hopelessly lost . for example , one of the film \\' s main ( nefarious ) characters is senator palpatine . for those of you not recently steeped in \" star wars \" trivia , emperor palpatine is that scary hooded apparition who was darth vader \\' s master in \" return of the jedi \" and \" empire strikes back . \" so , obviously , his appearance in \" phantom menace \" is meant to stir some echoes of his later role in the series , thus making his role here more meaningful . a lot of the movie is like that . r2 - d2 and c - 3po make token appearances , and it \\' s obvious that lucas is banking on the audience \\' s pre - existing fondness for them . . . because he doesn \\' t do much to add to it in any way . same goes for jabba the hutt , who doesn \\' t look as much mean here as he does corpulent and lazy . even * planets * make foreshadowing guest appearances in this film - tatooine ( the desert world where luke grew up ) , coruscant ( the cloud city from \" empire strikes back \" ) , and alderaan ( leia \\' s home planet - which we never actually see - that gets blown up in \" star wars \" ) show up or are mentioned briefly in passing . what \\' s the result of tying so many plot points and characters to future films ? the answer is that this one seems surprisingly empty . there \\' s no meat - no substance - that makes you want to love the characters as they are , not as they will be . another problem is that there are actually * too many * alien characters in the film . i was distracted by the fact that two of the main evil characters - strange looking aliens who looked like gila monsters - had mouths that barely moved , making them look more like muppets than actual characters . and jar jar binks , a silly roger rabbitish amphibious character , is intended as comic relief , but what he really becomes is annoying - and fast . unlike chewbacca and c - 3po , who got their humanity ( if you \\' ll pardon the expression ) from their interactions with the human characters , jar jar is often left to interact mostly with others of his kind , at times making the movie seem like nothing more than a very expensive \" teenage mutant ninja turtles . \" furthermore , the dialogue is often stilted and corny , and sometimes downright infantile , thereby rendering some characters into nothing more than bystanders to the plot . oddly , this isn \\' t just * my * judgment - lucas has said that he designed this film for kids . well , he \\' s done a good job . the hero of this film , of course , is young anakin , but it was very hard for me to feel any kinship or identify with an eight - year - old boy . that \\' s not jake lloyd \\' s fault , though - he does a good job of being a cute kid , which is apparently all lucas asked of him . that \\' s another mistake , of course , because the cute tyke becomes darth vader . warning : spoilers ahead ! ! ! ! in my opinion , there was not nearly enough foreshadowing of anakin \\' s future evil in the film . the boy is all blond flowing hair and rosy cheeks , and there \\' s nothing more than a spark of aggression in him throughout the entire movie . he has a doting mother ( pernilla august , making her first english - language film ) and is a slave to a gross flying gnome on tatooine . but the only indication the audience gets that this kid isn \\' t all hearts and roses is yoda \\' s hesitation in allowing him to train as a jedi under qui - gon jinn . his explanation ? \" his future is clouded . \" ( warning : major spoiler ahead . enter at your own risk . ) of course , the noble qui - gon dies at the hand of darth maul , a scary - looking sith lord who excels at the jedi arts , but has turned to the dark side . this dude has maybe two lines in the entire movie , but he establishes his presence through his amazing moves with his double - sided lightsaber , and his scary facial makeup . because qui - gon never gets a chance to train the young anakin in the ways of the force , obi - wan , qui - gon \\' s young padawan apprentice ( one level below knightdom ) , must take over the training himself . so , at the end of the movie , we end where the saga actually begins - with obi - wan kenobi and his young apprentice , anakin \" darth vader \" skywalker . did this story need to be told ? i would say no . but is it a worthwhile movie to see ? absolutely . if you don \\' t enter the theater with jedi - size expectations , and you simply want to be treated to an enjoyable visual spectacle , then this is your movie . the tatooine pod races are a triumph of effects and computer animation . the digitalized backgrounds on some of the planets are an astonishing sight . and yoda and young obi - wan are worth seeing for their origins in a simpler , happier time . above all , this is a fun movie . not deep , not meaningful , and not profound . but fun . maybe next time , lucas will hire lawrence kasdan to co - write the script , and the guy who directed \" empire \" will direct . because if lucas does the next one himself , it will be lacking the one thing it needs the most - potential . : )',\n",

       " (\"my giant begins with a monologue that ' s more funny than not and a distinctive ` princess bride , ' medieval fairy - tale - in - the - ? 90s feel . i was pleasantly surprised how sharp the comedy was , with very funny scenes occurring on a movie set in romania where talent agent sammy ( billy crystal ) is visiting a client and in the monastery where sammy ends up after being mysteriously saved when he accidentally plunges his car into a stream . and when sammy meets max , his giant , mysterious savior played by gheorghe muresan , there is magic in the air ; albeit it a bit goofy , i loved every minute of it . the film , of course , plays on the size difference between the two , and at times you would almost swear it must be special effects . i particularly enjoyed a shot of sammy dangling his legs from a max - sized chair as the two face each over an enormous table and eat from oversized bowls and spoons . i also liked jere burns ' ( from tv ' s ` something so right ' ) performance as the director of the film in romania . at this point , the primary flaw in the film is that gheorghe muresan is incredibly hard to understand , particularly during his fast - paced first scene . it is unfortunate that the script required him to speak quickly right out of the gate , as i did understand him more as the film continued and i became accustomed to his speech . however , about the time muresan becomes coherent , the characters head to new york and the film takes a dive . off the high board . suddenly , we are expected to believe sammy is a do - whatever - it - takes slime ball . up until this point he was pursuing his own interests to be sure , but he didn ' t come off as a desperate jerk . if he had , the first scenes could never have been so lighthearted and magical . but now , in new york , we are further introduced to his neglected wife and son , and his character is desperate enough to involve max in a disturbing giant vs . midgets wrestling match , which i found quite unpleasant and jarring within the framework of the film . indeed , many scenes stuck out of this film like incorrectly placed puzzle pieces . this includes the scenes featuring steven seagal , when sammy gets max a role in a big , hollywood movie filming in las vegas . while i enjoyed seeing seagal poke fun at himself , the scenes appeared to exist solely because of his participation , rather than because the film demanded it . and the audience is required to take a huge leap to believe that max would win the role based on his quotations of shakespeare . at this point i found myself thinking , ` we ' re supposed to believe that someone would cast this guy in a film ? ' then i realized he was , and i was watching it . in the final third , the film undergoes another transformation , this time to unbridled sentimentality . note : major plot points are revealed in this and the final paragraph . max went to america because sammy promised to reunited him with his childhood love , lillianna , who hasn ' t seen him since he was a normal - sized kid . her refusal to see max ( unbeknownst to him ) leads us to an awkward ` ends justify the means ' scene as sammy ' s wife serena , played nicely by kathleen quinlan , poses as lillianna . i found this scene offensive . not only did it rely on deception to induce warm , fuzzy feelings from the audience , it reduced max to someone we should pity and coddle , which i thought was quite undeserved . i think max could have handled the truth , gratuitous illness and all . late in the film we learn max , and in fact all giants , have a heart condition which shortens their lives considerably . this could be an enlightening revelation , but the film seemingly presents it only to justify sammy ' s transformation into a caring , sensitive guy -- and hey , a great dad and husband , too ! ` my giant ' suffers from a poorly constructed story line and undeveloped characters whose actions are determined by plot points rather than their own internal persuasions . a stronger story with more room for character growth might have been possible if the focus was on max ' s struggle to be accepted and cast in movies instead of sammy ' s struggles to get money and become a better person . in this scenario , max ' s illness could have been a integral part of the film not a story motivator . sentiment and emotion would have followed naturally . instead , we ' re apparently not supposed to like sammy until the end , but we ' re not allowed to focus on max . crystal and muresan give adequate and at times enjoyable performances , but in the end , ` my giant ' left me feeling like i ' d been fed gruel from a giant spoon .\",\n",

( the title is taken from brooks \\' wish that nasa would send a payload of hundreds of expendable robots to scurry about the martian surface , creating a sort of road map for the terrain -- fast , cheap , and out of control . ) with able assists from editors karen schmeer and shondra merrill and cinematographer robert richardson ( oliver stone \\' s longtime collaborator ) , this becomes a cinematic contraption that \\' s a wonder of narrative divergence and coherence . ( further enhancing the picture \\' s wacky intellectual mood is the playful score by alloy orchestra founder caleb sampson . ) different story threads inform and comment on one another with the serene inscrutability of a kieslowski film , or a surrealist dream . by cobbling together out of these motley musings a thesis on the nature of craftsmanship , invention , and existence itself , morris reveals the presence of cosmic themes -- creation , evolution , death -- in earthbound lives . at the same time , and just as significantly , he pays tribute to a consuming passion for one \\' s work . this breakdown of the dichotomy between the everyday and the extraordinary is likely as profound as anything you \\' ll encounter in pop culture this year , and the visuals cry out for the big screen . don \\' t miss it . -------------------------------------------------------------- directed by errol morris edited by karen schmeer and shondra merrill cinematography by robert richardson music by caleb sampson u . s . , 1997 --------------------------------------------------------------',\n",

not even the tv series got that stupid ( at least not on the grand scale of stupidity that \" batman & robin \" showcases ) . frustrating too are the various supporting characters that walk on and off with nothing to say or do . blink , and you \\' ll miss elle macpherson as julie madison , vivica fox as a \" why is she even in the film \" vamp in freeze \\' s lair ( with all of two lines ) , and pat hingle as the most ineffectual commissioner gordan the batman series ever had . and in what almost seems like an effort to save on costs , vendela kirsebom has no lines as mrs . fries -- she isn \\' t even filmed well enough to look good ( trust me , she \\' s quite attractive outside of this dreck ) . and as if the film weren \\' t bad enough to limp along with bad direction , bad dialogue , bad performances , and bad fight scenes , there are inconsistencies and illogic galore . i know it \\' s nit - picky to ask where the hundreds of feet of cable are stored in the batarangs , why the character \\' s arms aren \\' t ripped out of their sockets when they accomplish a one - armed batarang save after falling hundreds of feet ( while holding on to another person no less ) , or where the moisture comes from when freeze \\' s weapon creates tons if ice . that \\' s all traditional comic book stuff . but why does batman spring a trap for freeze at a public charity event that endanger the lives of hundreds of by - standers ? why is there a big switch clearly marked , \" heat \" in mr . freeze \\' s lair ? why do countless bumbling police officers even try to take on mr . freeze hand to hand ? why does alfred encourage silverstone to become batgirl and even go so far as to have a suit made for her ? why do batman & robin take 10 minutes to bicker before leaving the batcave in response to an emergency ? and since it established early on that ivy is using pheromones , why don \\' t they wear masks to filter it out ?

       " (\"it ' s actually not so bad that dreamworks decided to release the love letter at about the same time as star wars episode i : the phantom menace , because this way less people will have to sit through this dreadful little comedy . and no , i really don ' t feel guilty about wishing this movie death at the box - office . really , i don ' t . not at all . the plot has been done before -- a mysterious , unaddressed love letter shows up in a small town , causing confusion for everyone who reads it . the center of the ensuing disaster is bookstore owner helen ( kate capshaw , and by the way , what is it with bookstore owner main characters ? in the past year and a half we ' ve seen them in life is beautiful , you ' ve got mail , this movie , and the upcoming notting hill ) , who finds the letter in between couch cushions in the bookstore . she immediately starts testing other people to see who it might be from , and comes to the ( incorrect ) conclusion that the author of the note is a young employee played by tom everett scott . he , reading the letter himself , assumes that she wrote it for him . after a while , they fall in love ( well , duh ) . kate feels guilty about getting in a relationship with someone more than twenty years younger than her , and she also feels guilty because at the same time she is also involved with the town fireman ( tom selleck ) . to add to her turmoil , her mother shows up ( blythe danner , who apparently must have had her daughter when she was about 9 ) and her trusted bookstore manager ( deadpan ellen degeneres ) quits . supporting characters aren ' t called supporting for nothing . their purpose isn ' t just to move the plot along , they ' re also supposed to give the storyline a backbone . to do this , they must exhibit at least marginal depth and must also be interesting . rarely can a movie work if it puts an interesting protagonist in the middle and surrounds her with hackneyed , dull , cardboard secondary characters , especially when at the core of the movie is the protagonist ' s various interactions with them . this is the love letter ' s damning error . capshaw ' s character is as good as i have seen present in recent romantic comedies , but the people that surround her are all either underwritten or purely one - dimensional . because of that , the love letter is awkward and insincere . even worse -- it ' s a bore . i liked capshaw and her helen , but everyone else is painfully fake , undermining the little drama or sexual tension that has the potential to exist . there is nothing particularly hilarious about all this either -- and besides degeneres ' wisecracks , there ' s little that is even a little amusing . this is not a completely thoughtless film and director peter ho - sun chan does a good job of portraying helen ' s yearnings and various subtle complexities . but it ' s far from profound . there isn ' t a common theme running through the proceedings , thus the movie seems thoughtfully pointless . really , this is a harmless little movie ; it ' s far from an abomination and it ' s not torturous to sit through . but bad , it is . awful , it also is . the love letter is a failure , and an inane failure at that . ? 1999 eugene novikov &# 137 ;\",\n",

       " ('in 1994 , an insider \\' s look at a scandal - ridden run for the democratic presidential nomination ( closely based on clinton \\' s 1992 campaign ) was written anonymously ( former newsweek writer joe klein later claimed true authorship ) . now , the book , primary colors , has been made into a movie , directed by mike nichols , and , in light of recent presidential scandals , seems to be more relevant than ever . but the film is more than a diatribe against , or a paean in praise of , the president . it is a fascinating look at the political machinery , and the ethical quagmire , that surround modern politics . jack stanton ( john travolta ) is the governor of a small southern state running for the democratic presidential nomination . he is charismatic , but has several flaws which threaten to doom his campaign , and strains his relationship with his wife , susan ( emma thompson ) . the film is told from the point of view of henry burton ( adrian lester ) , grandson of a civil rights leader , who is swept away by stanton \\' s ideals and helps to organize the campaign . he joins political strategist richard jemmons ( billy bob thornton , looking an awful lot like james carville ) , and campaign advisor daisy green ( maura tierney ) . governor stanton \\' s past repeatedly pops up to haunt him , a fact that his chief rival , lawrence harris ( kevin cooney ) , consistently uses to his advantage . to help clean up the stanton campaign , jack and susan bring in an old friend , libby \" the dustbuster \" holden ( kathy bates ) . the acting throughout primary colors is superb . it would be worth seeing the movie for bates \\' wild performance alone . she enlivens the atmosphere with energy in a truly boisterous performance . travolta does a fair clinton impersonation as governor stanton , although his accent does stray a little . emma thompson delivers a strong performance as his suffering wife who can \\' t let anything show that might hurt the presidential run . the problem with political movies is that they tend to alienate over half of their audience by promoting one side or the other , or else the movie is vague to the point of boredom . primary colors treads lightly on this issue . though stanton is clearly portrayed as a democrat , and there are a few minor barbs thrown in the way of republicans , the movie touches on few actual political issues . in fact , most of the \" bad guys \" are fellow democrats on the same road to the white house . rather than issues , the film is primarily concerned about scandals and spin control . although the film strays into some obviously non - clinton territory , it is difficult to completely separate it from reality ( particularly when certain scenes seem to highlight the president \\' s current troubles ) . primary colors \\' chief problem is its length . it runs about 15 minutes too long . there are some scenes which could have easily been cut . for example , midway through the film , the candidate gives a speech to an assembly of laid off machinists . the scene \\' s only apparent purpose is to establish stanton \\' s character , which has already been done in similar scenes earlier in the film . the extra length isn \\' t long enough nor tiring enough to be annoying , but it mars an otherwise excellent film . republicans , democrats , and political agnostics should all be able to find something to like in primary colors . it \\' s a funny , and at some times shocking , look at the modern political process .',\n",

       " ('it \\' s terribly unfortunate that \" stir of echoes , \" tautly written and directed by david koepp ( who made one of 1996 \\' s unsung treasures , \" the trigger effect \" ) , should be released little more than a month after \" the sixth sense , \" which is still going strong at the box office . these two films are undoubtedly going to be compared ( judging from practically all of my fellow audience members last night ) , and although they have eerily similar storylines , \" stir of echoes \" is more of a straightforward psychological horror film , while \" the sixth sense \" is closer to a psychological drama . additionally , while \" the sixth sense \" had a shocker of an ending that undoubtedly has been one of the major factors in its recent repeat business , \" stir of echoes \" is more conventional and predictable in its final twist . and where \" the sixth sense \" was disturbing , \" stir of echoes \" is just plain scary . i have a feeling most viewers are going to come away unimpressed because of the unavoidable similarities , and will foolishly forget to judge this film on its own respectable merits . adapted from a novel by richard matheson that was written some forty years ago , \" stir of echoes \" opens with a cute six - year - old boy named jake ( zachary david cope ) who is taking a bath . he is speaking directly at the screen , but we immediately have a feeling someone else is there . finally , he asks , \" does it hurt to be dead ? \" apparently jake sees the ghosts of dead people , but unlike \" the sixth sense , \" this young child isn \\' t the focus of the picture . instead , tom witzy ( kevin bacon ) , a chicago lineman , is our protagonist . jake is his son , and maggie ( kathryn erbe ) , whom has just discovered she is six weeks pregnant , is his hard - working wife . one night while at a party with their closest friends , tom convinces maggie \\' s new - age sister , lisa ( illena douglas ) , to try and hypnotize him . it unexpectedly works , and before long , tom is seeing things he wouldn \\' t normally see , including a deceased teenage girl ( jenny morrison ) in his house who happens to have been missing for the last six months . seeking help from lisa , she tells him that , while he was under hypnosis , she told him that after he awoke , his mind will remain clear and free , like an opened door . she didn \\' t expect it to work , but it did , and the only way to stop it is for tom to somehow find a way to help this girl he sees . \" stir of echoes \" isn \\' t a perfect film by any stretch of the imagination , but in the thick , atmospheric mood it conjures up , it is a terrifically eerie domestic horror - drama , and is not only effective on a technical level , but is impressive in its portrayal of a struggling working - class family . kevin bacon and , especially , kathryn erbe ( 1997 \\' s \" dream with the fishes \" ) , are top - notch and exceedingly believable as a loving married couple who nonetheless have their fair share of problems . after tom is hypnotized and starts seeing ghastly visions , he is completely taken over by his desire to solve this mystery of the disappearing girl whom he has seen lurking in his house , and instead of maggie not being understanding , she instead believes what tom says , and aside from being a little worried by what he is going through , does not try to stop his pursuit . bacon and erbe are not traditional hollywood stars like tom cruise and julia roberts , and therefore , are easier to relate to and always plausible as a struggling couple who have to work overtime at their jobs just to make ends meet . in a masterfully - done , entrancing sequence , tom is hypnotized by lisa , but instead of watching him , we instead see what he sees , starting from his view as he closes his eyes into darkness . lisa tells him to visualize being in an empty movie theater , and so , we , as audience members , are watching a movie screen from inside a theater , which is also showing a movie screen in a theater . telling him to move closer and closer to the screen as a fuzzy word in black letters pops up on the screen , we begin to float closer and closer to the front of the theater until we see that the word is \" sleep . \" never before have i seen a hypnotism scene as mesmerizing and brilliantly - construed as this one . truthfully , this set - piece , and another in which tom wakes up from a nightmarish dream only to quickly discover he is reliving what he has just dreamt , are worth the full price of admission alone , just to see them on the big screen . having loads of fun with her small role as maggie \\' s sister , lisa , illeana douglas ( 1995 \\' s \" to die for , \" her last great character ) is a delight , but rarely used to her full advantage in feature films . funny and enjoyably offbeat , douglas gets to utter the best line in the film : while talking to maggie about tom \\' s visions of the girl , she remarks , \" i wouldn \\' t be worried about him seeing another girl , although the fact that she \\' s dead gives one pause . \" also of note are jenny morrison ( 1994 \\' s \" intersection \" ) , who is truly poignant in the last half of the film when we flash back to see what really happened to her missing character , and liza weil , remarkable in 1998 \\' s \" whatever , \" as morrison \\' s grieving teenage sister , debbie . if the resolution of \" stir of echoes \" does not live up to its obviously frightful full potential ( and it doesn \\' t ) , what comes before is both involving and appropriately gritty . the music score , by james newton howard , and unsettling use of whispers and ghostly sound effects , successfully compliment and foreshadow the off - kilter frame - of - mind that tom is put into , and director david koepp proves once again that he is a director with a knack for creating almost unbearably tense situations that revolve around realistically - written characters . \" stir of echoes \" isn \\' t as good as \" the sixth sense , \" but why should it need to be ? both films are fully capable of standing on their own two feet , and \" stir of echoes \" really is a spinetinglingly good horror film .',\n",

       " (\"jonathan demme ' s _beloved_ , based on the book toni morrison , is a study in skillful literary adaptation . on the one hand , the film manages to recreate key moments from the novel , evoking morrison ' s pragmatic narrative style without using her authorial voice . on the other hand , beloved omits the some of the finer details of the book , favoring an ambiguously defined back story upon which to build the story ' s main events . this choice is a smartly made one , for it creates an open space in which the story ' s wide range of emotions can gestate and grow . indeed , the impact of the film is so protracted that much of it cannot be felt until long after the end credits have rolled . _beloved_ takes place in the second half of the 19th century , during the so - called reconstruction era after the civil war . for newly - freed slaves , it is a time of confusion and turmoil . oprah winfrey is sethe , a slave who escaped a kentucky plantation and took her children to an ohio farmhouse , where she hoped the terror would end . what she did not know was that it would follow her there , and remain with her long after the physical threat had vanished . _beloved_ ultimately tells the story of sethe ' s search for forgiveness , one long - hampered by an unforgettable sin . the film starts off on a dreary day ten years after sethe ' s escape , as a violent , unseen energy rocks her dilapidated farmhouse . invisible hands terrorize her family , flinging objects across rooms , shaking tables , rattling floorboards . sethe ' s sons run away , perhaps for good , leaving sethe and her daughter denver to fend for themselves . demme ' s matter - of - fact handling of this supernatural element is just one of _beloved_ ' s intriguing aspects . all of the characters take for granted that ghosts are real . when paul d ( danny glover ) -- a former slave who escaped kentucky along with sethe -- arrives at the house eight years later and is confronted with the ghost ' s hellish visions , he doesn ' t run in terror . instead , he asks who the ghost is . as in morrison ' s novel , demme quickly establishes that the horror of the story will not come from the fact of the ghost itself , but from the terrifying past in which the ghost was created . sethe is the one being haunted , but the ghost in the house is the least of her fears . in fact , the ghost is one of the reasons she chooses to stay . the story takes an bizarre turn with the appearance of beloved ( thandie newton ) , a young black - clad woman who appears on sethe ' s front lawn , leaned christ - like against a tree stump . sethe and denver immediately take to the rasping woman and try to nurse her to health . they know not who she is , but that doesn ' t matter . only paul d is suspicious of the stranger . little does the family know that beloved will bring about many changes , and force sethe to release a guilt she has held onto so urgently for eighteen years . winfrey is arguably beloved ' s greatest asset . she inhabits the role of sethe so convincingly it is hard to believe this is the same woman who shines brightly on a tv talk show . lisa gay hamilton does an impressive job in the emotionally demanding role as the younger sethe , whose appalling actions make her the disturbed woman we see eighteen years later . danny glover is affable as the sympathetic paul d , as is kimberly elise as denver , sethe ' s wanderlusting daughter . as sethe ' s sage - like mother - in - law old baby suggs , beah richards authoritatively commands every scene in which she appears . the film ' s least palatable choice of casting is unfortunately that of the role of beloved herself . thandie newton plays the glassy - eyed girl with a demented fervor which is endearing at first , but which becomes off - putting and unintentionally laughable by the end . departing from the honed aesthetic he used in such films as _the silence of the lambs_ and _melvin & howard_ , director demme has used a bit of dramatic overstatement to get across the vivid descriptions in morrison ' s novel . totemic camera shots and color - saturated scenery are decidedly uncommon in demme ' s films , but the few he uses here work to the film ' s benefit . _beloved_ ' s most memorable scenes are those of baby suggs ' gatherings in a forest clearing , where the bright yellow - greens of nature entrance the viewer as much as suggs ' words do . for the most part , though , demme maintains his trademark directorial neutrality . this , combined with morrison ' s equally frugal method of storytelling , may make _beloved_ somewhat of a challenge to watch , even to those familiar with the book . though the film compliments the book extraordinarily well , it falls short in allowing the sort of accessibility one usually expects from a film . nothing is spoon - fed to the viewer . morrison ' s novel is just as enigmatic , but unlike a movie , a book can be put down to allow the various undercurrents and themes to churn and absorb . the movie begins like _poltergeist_ , and ends like _the color purple_ , with shades of _the scarlet letter_ and _little women_ somewhere in the middle . taken as a whole , beloved is a disquieting , one - of - a - kind experience , one to be viewed with guards down and spirits in abeyance .\",\n",

( in addition , the film takes a bite into race - related issues , and never develops them at all . ) there are a lot of scenes like this one , and none of them are very coherent . there ' s also a considerable language barrier , given that chow and some of the other actors have thick chinese accents . the plot itself never straightens out . i ' m not sure who or what the fukienese dragons are , or why henry lee is associated with them , or what they do as a group . the corruptor is an action movie , and so all these weird plot developments are decorated with loud and violent action sequences . the sequences aren ' t bad , but they ' re not new ; how many car chases through chinatown have you seen ? on that note , how many chinatown cop movies have you seen ? one too many , i ' d imagine . foley ' s strength is clearly in characterization , and he does a pretty good job here . the scenes between nick and danny are very good , and i actually got a feel for their characters ; a bond forms between them that holds parts of the film together . chow and wahlberg are both good actors ; chow is a pro , and can do this kind of stuff in his sleep . wahlberg seems less at home in this atmosphere , but he ' s still fun to watch . i also liked the subplot involving danny ' s father ; brian cox ' s performance is powerful , and his character makes a compelling moral compass for danny . but the film ultimately fails , mostly at the hands of insane incoherence and overly - familiar action scenes . a complicated plot can be successful , but the story needs to make sense when it ' s over . the corruptor never manages to make any sense -- it just keeps spinning out of control until , finally , there ' s nothing left to hold on to .\",\n",

cum - detective who , on the morning of february 14th , discovers a \" valentine \" just outside his new york cave : one of ella fitzgerald \\' s strange fruit , stuck in the crotch of a tree -- a young male model murdered and frozen to a branch . believing at first that his imagined nemesis stuyvesant , shooting evil rays into his mind from atop the chrysler building , is responsible for the murder , romulus ( samuel l . jackson ) is put on the trail of an avant - garde photographer in the mapplethorpe mould , david leppenraub ( colm feore ) . his minor sleuthing interrupted by the occasional delusional fit and bouts with an ecstasy of creation ( romulus was a brilliant julliard - trained pianist prior to his psychosis ) , romulus uncovers clues and harasses suspects on his way to convincing his police - woman daughter ( aunjanue ellis ) that even though he \\' s a nut , that doesn \\' t mean that he can \\' t solve a high - profile society murder . every moment an exhausting workshop of ideas , and every character the same , _the caveman \\' s valentine_ is a concept so \" high concept \" that it suddenly became clear to me that the film fits into the comic book genre of entertainment , with romulus \\' s \" caveman \" a slightly more mundane version of todd mcfarlane \\' s urban noir hero , spawn . with a long - vanished wife ( tamara tunie ) acting as a spiritual guide , the occasional social caste commentary , the secret base in a cave , a divergent genius personality with a network of informants and supporters , and a wickedly colourful arch - enemy , the film piles on the lurid comic book details and dizzying slapdash colours to such a lavish extent that i was vaguely surprised that the blue police cars weren \\' t inscribed with \" gotham pd . \" that being said , _the caveman \\' s valentine_ can only really succeed as a heroic fantasy , a frank miller graphic novel that has the audacity to portray the blood staining a field of virgin snow expanding to form the shape of a heart . the difficulties with the film spring from the misunderstanding that it somehow adheres to the conventions of a thriller or a police procedural when , in fact , _the caveman \\' s valentine_ is a superhero fable that takes on the cause of the homeless ( again like mcfarlane \\' s spawn ) while attacking the entrenched ruling classes in government and the arts . it is no small detail that our hero , romulus , is not only named for a member of the ruling class who lived his life ( in legend ) without knowledge of his royal birth , but also that our romulus has turned his back on the comforts of the literati in favour of a mystical existence living in a cave in a park . in the romulus mythology , signs of romulus \\' royal blood is brought by twelve vultures , while in the film , the call to action for our hero comes in the form of not the carrion birds , but of the carrion itself . whether or not romulus of _the caveman \\' s valentine_ will found a nation , or , in the case of novelist george dawes green , upon whose novel his own screenplay is based , a franchise , the fact remains that _the caveman \\' s valentine_ is easily the most misunderstood film of 2001 thus far . it , along with m . night shyamalan \\' s _unbreakable_ , is a mature cinematic extrapolation of the graphic novel format which has , since miller \\' s seminal \" the dark knight returns \" , redefined the comic medium as one suitable for mature ruminations on psychologically sticky topics . readers of sam keith \\' s brilliant \" the maxx \" comic series ( or of mtv \\' s short - lived animated adaptation of the same ) are already familiar with the idea of a homeless man placed in the position of knight errant and king of his own twisted demesne . the failure of both \" the maxx \" tv show and of _the caveman \\' s valentine_ ( not forgetting the initial backlash against _unbreakable_ ) suggests that the public may not be ready for america \\' s surprising contributions to dark fantasy . luxuriantly lit , brashly saturated , and comic - panel framed with a virtuoso grace by cinematographer amy vincent ( _death in venice , ca_ ) , while inhabiting robin standefer \\' s ( _practical magic_ ) mesmerizing sets , _the caveman \\' s valentine_ is an unremittingly gorgeous film . kasi lemmons , following up her brilliant 1997 debut , _eve \\' s bayou_ , which played on similar themes of manufactured realities and mysticism , fulfills much of her immense promise with a tale of seraphs and lost boys , artists and suffering . _the caveman \\' s valentine_ is an elegant and piquant expression of hope for justice in a tilted landscape . clearly not for every taste , when approached with the correct paradigm , it is one of the most stunning and intensely fascinating films of the year : a redefinition of the hero archetype for a post - modern audience with urine - stained wool trench coats in place of blue tights and red capes . _the caveman \\' s valentine_ is a fine and a courageous film , crazy enough to suggest that the delirious yammering of an idiot savant is the best and truest paladin of order in the chaos of eliot \\' s rat \\' s alley wasteland .',\n",

       " (\"usually when one is debating who the modern queen of the romantic comedy is they will bring up names like julia roberts or sandra bullock . others will mention meg ryan . but for me , it ' s not even close . janeane garofalo is not only the queen of the romantic comedy , she is the best comic actress in hollywood right now . and it ' s a good thing she ' s starring in the matchmaker , because without her presence the movie would be bland , unfunny , and dull . garofalo stars as marcy tizard , a top aide to boston senator john mcglory , who is suffering in the polls . in an attempt to capture the irish vote , he sends marcy on a mission to a small irish town called ballinagra in search of other mcglory ' s that never moved to america . unfortunately for marcy , her visit coincides with the town ' s annual matchmaking festival . things get off to a rocky start for marcy though . she has no hotel reservations ( for no rational reason ) and the tiny confined room ( tired old cliche ' ) she has to stay in has a visitor in her bathtub . his name is sean , and marcy finds him repugnant at first , so you can obviously tell where this is headed . the movie runs into a few roadblocks . for instance , the story is very thin . none of the characters ( except the old local matchmaker ) are nearly as interesting as garofalo . some of the characters , like the political aide played by denis leary , have wandered in from a completely different movie . i think the director realized this and decided to throw in numerous shots of the beautiful irish scenery , and several close - ups of garofalo ' s winning smile . the strange thing is that it works . garofalo ' s charm and the irish scenery could carry the thinnest of stories , and it carries this one .\",\n",

       " ('seen august 8 , 1998 at 6 p . m . at rotterdam square cinemas ( rotterdam , ny ) , theater # 6 , by myself for free using my sony / loews critic \\' s pass . [ theater rating : * * * : good seats , sound , and picture ] war is a topic that can \\' t help but be glorified any way it is portrayed by the media . movies , documentaries , and even history books have a way of making the darker side of humanity exciting since the most general aspects are focused on , such as strategy , politics , and victory . it \\' s easy to forget war , in its most basic form , is a battle of armies out to slaughter each other . forgotten more easily is the fact that each soldier , no matter what his rank or importance , is a real flesh - and - blood person and not just a number . \" saving private ryan \" is one of the few films that dares play up this aspect , especially in its unapologetic , realistic delivery . it proves there \\' s a huge difference between battling and killing . the film opens with one of the most graphic , disturbing scenes in recent memory . it \\' s world war ii , d - day to be exact , and the u . s . military is invading omaha beach where the nazis are more than ready for them . spielberg uses many techniques to create for a total sense of reality . instead of positioned cameras , the footage here seems to have been shot by camera operators running alongside soldiers as if they were just as scared . there is no sense of stability , but of constant , anxious , and confusing motion , giving us the feeling of being in the middle of the battle , and just a vulnerable as the poor troops . \" poor \" is a proper word to describe how pathetic and yet innocent the men fighting are . there is little to no dialogue throughout the loud battle and no prologue to define any characters . we don \\' t get the feeling these are handsome actors playing heroic roles , but that these are men about to kill and be killed for reasons beyond their understanding . the nazis are not portrayed as enemies to be hated , but as people that must be destroyed because they \\' re there . in the movies , the good guys can run through a firestorm of bullets and bombs and not get a scratch , but in reality that wouldn \\' t happen . the men have nothing to shield or protect them besides some metal flanks and dead bodies . they are sitting ducks and we realize this through the perspective of the well - secured germans who can actually see who , what , and where they \\' re shooting , unlike the americans who must fire in a general direction to avoid getting their heads blown off . perhaps the film is flawed by not providing any backstory on the war itself and who the men really are , but that seems to be part of the theme . the film seems to rely on the audience \\' s sense of patriotism , that the american military is \" right \" and good and that the nazis are \" inherently evil . \" the battle scene eventually focuses on a group of men who have miraculously survived and made their way close to the enemy stronghold ( a whole 50 - foot progression ) , and begin to inflict some damage . i have to admit that once the first glimpse of victory over the nazis sprang up , i couldn \\' t help but feel some sense of joy and relief . to triumph against all odds is a cliche to be sure , but there \\' s nothing cliche about the graphic , detailed , atmosphere here because it really happened . one of the most surprising aspects of the film is how little story construction there is , and yet the events that take place make sense and are interesting . the plot is practically irrelevant since the film is more concerned with the reality of the war and the soldiers we meet . tom hanks stars as captain miller , a relatively average man who happens to be the leader of a platoon . he \\' s never obsessive or any such generic , cartoonish characteristic that might dominate a character like this . he doesn \\' t want to be there any more than his men , but when he is given a mission he intends to carry it out . the mission the film is concerned with is , as the title states , saving private ryan . through a series of command started by an ordinary clerical worker , it is brought to a general \\' s attention that three brothers from iowa have been killed in action and their mother will receive notices of each \\' s death simultaneously . when they learn a fourth brother is stationed somewhere in europe , they make it a top priority to have him returned safely to his mother . it \\' s easy to sympathize with this situation , after all , no one should have to lose all their children at once . but finding one man in this war is , as miller puts it , \" like trying to find a needle in a stack of needles . \" the saving of private ryan isn \\' t just a dramatic device , but a thematic one . his salvation represents the sense of innocence the country , the world even , was trying to convince itself it still had . when miller \\' s company hears of the mission , they scoff at the idea assuming he is dead , but miller isn \\' t so quick to shrug it off . he knows the only thing that can really save soldiers from death is hope , and now he has the opportunity to make someone \\' s sense of hope a reality . the mission to find ryan gives miller \\' s group a destination , but not direction . along the way many things happen to them , both good and bad . a few battles are fought , not to be major accomplishments for the war , but because they encounter german soldiers and have no other choice . the act of killing itself becomes one of the film \\' s major philosophical metaphors . the soldiers don \\' t mind killing other soldiers in blind battle , but when they come across a lone survivor who begs them to let him go , they can barely stop themselves from killing him in cold blood as some kind of vengeance for their losses . unfortunately , death is a fact of war , and most films try to avoid it when it comes to the main characters , but here spielberg doesn \\' t want us to think these men are invincible . in fact , only a small amount of color and personality is sketched into each man , and the performances are good enough to make this method work . although the characters are somewhat typical , the actors maintain control over the material at all time . whether they \\' re arguing with each other , telling stories of back home , or fighting the germans , they never go overboard and always seem believable . sure , there \\' s a zinger here and there , but war doesn \\' t change the fact boys will be boys . if and when one dies we too can feel the loss , even though we hardly knew them . the final act brings the story full circle with another tremendous , violent battle sequence . private ryan has been found , but facing four to one odds , can the americans defeat the germans and keep ryan alive ? that \\' s not a premise for thrills , it \\' s symbolic of everything the film has worked for . it would be wrong to say the film has either a happy or sad ending , it ends the way it must end . i remember reading a \" calvin & hobbes \" comic strip where calvin asked his dad something like , \" dad , how do armies of men killing each other solve problems ? \" \" saving private ryan \" is the adult version of that question .',\n",

       " (\"when a film is produced on a shoestring budget by a couple of hardworking filmmakers and when it tells the story of a genuine tragedy , the easy path for a reviewer who hated the movie is to give it a pass . toss out your usual objectivity , ignore how many times you checked your watch while viewing it , forget how unbearable it was to sit through , and find some meaningless way to compliment it . this , of course , will be of no service to your readers , but at least you ' ll avoid the hate mail from the movie ' s fans . thus it is with a heavy heart that i review the movie paulina ( not to be confused with the recent movie paulie about a talking parrot ) . directed by vicky funari as a labor of intense love - she spent the last one third of her life on film - the movie blends documentary footage with historic and fanciful recreations to relate the bitterly sad and true story of paulina cruz suarez . paulina was a maid in vicky ' s household when vicky was young . i got to learn the film ' s background when i attended a screening in which the two women who made it were present . for those without such context , the reaction to the film may be that it is a parody of a bad indie film . the acting is amateurish , the story is maudlin , and it has all the visual appeal of a bad home movie . grainy and overexposed , the movie , shot on 16mm film and videotape , has little to recommend it . confusingly composed , the movie jumps about jarringly as it tells its story . quite bloody at times , the story , full of horrific images , seems designed to shock and repulse us . why else would you include a scene with a completely nude and bloody 8 - year - old paulina ? another scene has a teenage paulina being fondled on a bus by the man sitting next to her . in retaliation , she bites off part of his finger . this covers the both of them in a bucket of blood . the passengers on the bus then view the girl in their minds as everything from saint to sinner . one , for example , sees her as an aztec priestess holding out a large heart that she had just cut from a body . the lugubrious tale has paulina being raped and beaten . certainly she had to endure a miserable life . but that does not guarantee that a movie about her will necessarily being good . i felt trapped in the theater watching it . only the opportunity to talk with the filmmakers afterwards made the movie bearable . paulina runs 1 : 28 . the film is in spanish with english subtitles . it is not rated but would be an r for violence and nudity and would be acceptable for older teenagers .\",\n",

       " (\"it is always refreshing to see a superstar actor who gets paid more than enough to forget about working for a living to want to take a chance and play a less - than - savoury character as mel gibson does in payback . of course , if i was being paid $ 25 million for one month ' s work , i ' d probably be willing to take risks as well , but that ' s neither here nor there . payback is based on a novel by richard stark ( apparently actually donald e . westlake , author of the grifters , itself a fine crime film ) which was also filmed in the 1960s as point blank starring one of the toughest of tough guys , lee marvin . the film opens with gibson having recovered from being shot several times in the back , by whom we don ' t know yet . all we know is that gibson , as porter , isn ' t a happy chappy and is hellbent on getting the money stolen from him back , and getting even in the process , no matter what the consequences . it turns out that the man he ' s after is val ( gregg henry ) , his sometime partner with whom he stole a briefcase full of cash from a gang of chinese mobsters . obviously not having much of a crisis of the soul , val figures porter is dead and goes about using his share of the money to pay off a debt to his employers . porter , however , is the sort of man who holds a grudge and once on his feet , goes about exacting revenge on the double - crossing val . gibson gives a terrific performance in the sort of role which he was born to play , that of a slightly unhinged guy who doesn ' t mind beating up or shooting people to get what he wants . you probably wouldn ' t see other actors in his salary range take such an offbeat , out - of - character role such as porter ( jim carrey won ' t be doing anything like this in a hurry after what happened the last time he tried - the cable guy , anyone ? ) . harrison ford ' s idea of playing an unsympathetic character is presumed innocent ; the last time schwarzenegger played a villain was batman and robin , which we won ' t mention further ; and has stallone ever really played a villain at all ? this is not to say that porter is a villain , per se . while he isn ' t the sort of character you wouldn ' t want to get on the wrong side of , he ' s nothing compared to some of the ones we are forced to watch in countless bad thrillers and action films where they kill innocent people in the blink of an eye or execute their right - hand men just to prove how mean they are . porter is only trying to get back what is not - so - rightfully his , which in a way is almost understandable . payback is an enjoyable dramatic black comedy - thriller which won ' t be remembered as being among gibson ' s most important work , but is still one of the finer films he ' s done . the only real problem with it is that , while everything seems to work out in the end , i was left feeling something was lacking ; was that all ? the ending looks as if it was tacked on at the last minute , and the final voice - over doesn ' t ring true , even though it was used to good effect elsewhere in the film - noir style the rest of the film embodies . the film just ends far too suddenly , after a huge build - up in the penultimate scenes . a fine film , even though it needs just a little something more to be the kind of a film that can be recommended without hesitation . just be ready for a possible letdown of an ending .\",\n",

) , but his kidnapped daughter , keiko ( china chow ) , also happens to be paris \\' goddaughter . so , when paris finds out she \\' s been kidnapped , he takes it personally and becomes determined to find out who did it . not knowing the cisco is actually behind the whole scheme , paris puts him in charge of rooting out the kidnapper . of course cisco blames the whole thing on poor , innocent melvin . along the way , there are several obligatory gunfights , explosions , and car chases , plus a literal cliffhanger inspired by \" jurassic park , \" and a completely unconvincing romance between melvin and keiko ( who looks like she \\' s barely pushing fifteen ) . what the movie passes off as humor resorts to thoroughly unfunny jokes about overweight jewish mothers , hara - kiri , drinking problems , leaking body bags , and a running gag about how crunch has recently discovered the pleasures of masturbation , and now spends all his time doing hand exercises . not to mention the pimply video store clerk who is always calling melvin and screeching about how he needs to return his copy of \" king kong lives , \" which is two weeks overdue . this mess of a movie was helmed by che - kirk wong , the latest hong kong director imported by john woo ( \" face / off \" ) , who also served as executive producer . woo needs to stop acting as a conduit for other directors , and start making more of his own films . wong , who directed such films as \" rock \\' n \\' roll cop \" back in hong kong , is completely tone deaf when it comes to comedy . maybe jokes about vexatious video clerks and vomiting on other people are funny across the ocean , but they \\' re not here , at least in the manner wong handles them . many of the problems can be traced back to the script , which was penned by obvious freshman writer ben ramsey . in addition to his vague characterizations and uninspired action sequences , ramsey \\' s script assaults the audience with his attempts to copy the vulgar , poetic rhythms of tarantino or mamet - style dialogue . what he comes out with is just a lot of annoying blather , most of which spews from the lips of lou diamond phillips ( whose favorite phrase is \" it \\' s all love \" ) and robin dunne , who plays cisco \\' s stuttering , black - wannabe assistant . the irritation factor of phillips and dunne combined is almost off the scale , which can pretty much describe the film as a whole .',\n",

turns out i was right , mostly . inspector gadget , oddly enough , follows almost exactly the same format as my favorite martian , down to the jive - talking side - kick . at first i thought it was done by the same people , but imdb informs me that ig was directed by david kellogg and written by dana olsen and kerry ehrin , where mfm was directed by donald petrie and written by sherri stoner and deanna oliver . this odd similarity between the two movies may best be explained by the studio that produced it , where \" formula \" isn \\' t just business , it \\' s a way of life . the producers who obviously micromanaged the two projects should get prominant screen credits . in some parts you can just hear them saying \" more zany ! i want more zany here -- and -- here . \" \" let \\' s have a really painful sexual reference for no reason right here -- make it really painful . i want the audience squirming in their seats . \" \" ok , that \\' s fine , but i want you to add bug guts . \" \" what does this scene do ?

' along those same lines , it ' s almost unfitting to compare the two ; johnson uses tension , humor , atmosphere , and suspense to create an original drama of forrest gumpian proportions . by no means has he developed a project of similar popularity - gump made over 300 million dollars while birch ought to pass out of sight in a few weeks - but the winning idea remains the same . simon birch is a different look at a different life , and one that will most likely be studied in film school classes in decades to come . in the present , however , it ' s an enjoyable little picture that everyone ought to take a look at .\",\n",

       " ('after having heard so many critics describe \" return to me \" as an old - fashioned hollywood romance , i kept asking myself going into this movie : what exactly is an old - fashioned hollywood romance ? what made \" return to me \" old - fashioned and old - hollywood ? was it the tunes from sinatra , etc . , legendary singers the senior citizens in the film constantly harp on ? was it the glamorous , sophisticated feel ? the charisma of the two leads ? even now i can \\' t say that i have gotten any closer to the real answer , because i haven \\' t see that many old - fashioned hollywood romances . i don \\' t think any of the romances i \\' ve seen have been classified as such . which leaves me the option of vaguely agreeing with my fellow critics -- \" return to me \" was old - fashioned in the sense that it reminded me of the way the younger generation perceive venerated old hollywood magic , the way i perceive cinnamon spice and apple cider . it was traditional , magical . we knew it couldn \\' t be too daring , or have any surprising plot twists that many cynical modern romances are apt to throw in . it was a romance told with such endearing simplicity , tenderness , and love ( from director bonnie hunt ) that it couldn \\' t help but sparkle with charm despite its shortcomings . the film owes a lot of what it has to bonnie hunt \\' s direction . from the very first bird \\' s eye view of chicago , zooming in slowly toward the insignificant bob rueland ( david duchovny ) , accompanied by the \" return to me \" ballad ( by whom ? ) , we can tell we \\' re in for something sweet . the scenes between the characters are endearing , truthful , with just a hint of fantasy . real people don \\' t act that way ; real people aren \\' t that nice . we know all this , and yet we want to believe in these folks \\' existence . the premise itself seems to have sprung out of a fairytale , but hunt \\' s rooting the fairytale in common chicago folk simultaneously lends credit to the scenario and tinges everyday urban life with a hint of the ethereal . everything is ordinary -- yet beautiful -- in this film . > from the festive little family restaurant to grace ( minnie driver ) and bob \\' s wardrobes . from the eloquent , not - in - a - hurry to progress storyline to the dainty watercolors that grace paints . from the animal stars to the way all the characters interact on screen -- the most beautiful part . \" return to me \" has done an excellent job of assembling together a group of actors who blend in effortlessly as a family : the audience has no trouble at all believing that this rambunctious family actually does exist . we care for them , laugh with them , cry with them ; we \\' re concerned that the little boy will pick up cursing from his father . whatever hunt did , she brought out the naturalism in all of the actors . disappointingly , david alan grier \\' s charlie , however much i like him , was the most flatly - written . duchovny here does a laudable job of shaking off his fox mulder persona -- with the help of his fellow co - stars rarely do we see any hint of special agent fox mulder . instead we have a normal guy who when he falls in love shows more delight than fox mulder will show over the span of an entire season of \" the x - files . \" duchovny , who is excellent at understatement and self - deprecation as an actor showcases his considerable comedic talent on screen . minnie driver is engaging as always as the sweet , innocent grace with nothing but a good heart to offer . though an unlikely pair , duchovny and driver gradually warm up to each other as the movie progresses . while \" return to me \" functions remarkably as a laugh - out - loud comedy , a romantic scenic tour through chicago , and a tearjerker , the story is set up so the film ends up having nowhere to develop . the entire climax of the film hinges on when and how grace is going to tell bob that she actually was the recipient of his wife \\' s heart . we already know that there \\' s going to be a happy ending ; we feel like we spend the entire film , however enjoyably , in a straight line going towards that point . as a result bob and grace click almost too quickly -- yes , i know she \\' s supposed to have his ex - wife \\' s heart and everything -- it seems too effortless . the main subject is a love story , and the family scenes i love so much unfortunately are overused and distract from the turmoil of the two main characters ( whose story might not have that much meat after all ) . however , in the spirit of \" return to me , \" it won \\' t do to be too picky about how \" old \" hollywood tells its stories . i loved knowing that this was a labor of love for bonnie hunt . it shows . the bottom line : \" return to me \" is nothing remarkable , and yet its sweetness , sincerity , and charm might touch your heart in ways that you hadn \\' t imagined .',\n",

       " ('disney cements their place in the forefront of feature animation with the release of their latest animated adventure , mulan . while it adheres a bit too close to the disney formula to be perfect , it is nonetheless an entertaining film for both kids and adults . fa mulan ( ming - na wen , singing : lea salonga ) wants nothing more than to be a dutiful daughter and honor her family . . . it \\' s just that she doesn \\' t quite fit in with the chafing customs of her time . while most girls her age are trying to quietly and demurely seek the approval of the local matchmaker ( miriam margoyles ) , mulan would prefer speaking her mind . but there is trouble on the horizon . the evil huns , led by shan - yu ( miguel ferrer ) , are invading china . the emperor ( pat morita ) has decreed that each family must donate one man to serve in the army . the only male in mulan \\' s family is her father , fa zhou ( soon - tek oh ) , who , old and with a bad leg , honorably accepts his fate . mulan , on the other hand , decides to save her father \\' s life . . . by secretly masquerading as a man and taking his place on the battlefield . mulan , under the assumed name of ping , appears at camp where she , along with the other bumbling recruits , yao ( harvey fierstein ) , chien - po ( jerry tondo ) and ling ( gedde watanabe ) , are trained in the art of war by captain shang ( b . d . wong , singing : donny osmond ) . but she \\' s not alone in her tasks . . . in typical disney fashion , she has three animal companions : her horse khan , a lucky cricket crickey , and a pint - sized \" guardian \" dragon called mushu ( eddie murphy ) . much like the gargoyles in the hunchback of notre dame , the humor in mulan is lukewarm and doesn \\' t flow well with the rest of the more serious story . sure , some occasional comic relief is welcome , particularly in a film geared for the younger set , but mulan overdoes it . the overdose of humor turns what could have been a powerfully great film into a good , but schizophrenic experience . but , that commentary aside , this is a very well made film ( which makes the formulaic additions all the more regrettable ) . the animation is on par with some of disney \\' s best . the story itself is interesting , and the action scenes are awe - inspiring . the musical score to the film is enjoyable , though , as has been the case with disney \\' s recent work , the songs are mostly forgettable . at least , we \\' re only subjected to four of them this time around . mulan boasts the highest death toll of any disney cartoon to date . most of the killing is off - screen and it \\' s all highly depersonalized ( there \\' s nothing to compare with the death of mufasa or bambi \\' s mom ) . there \\' s nothing graphic , and the film resides snugly inside a g rating . children will probably have more questions about the restrictive ancient customs than of the slaughter of armies . it \\' s ironic that a film concerned with bucking tradition is hampered because of its strict adherence to disney tradition . if the filmmakers had the guts to lessen the humor , ax the compulsory songs , and remove the obligatory ( and somewhat unrealistic ) romance , they could have had a classic on their hands . instead , they merely deliver a very good time at the movies .',\n",

       " (\"i love movies . i really do . every time i watch great movies like goodfellas ( 1990 ) or raiders of the lost ark ( 1981 ) , a tear comes to my eye due to the awesome talent , skill and entertainment that is on display . even lower grade films such as the naked gun 33 1 / 3 ( 1994 ) or ghostbusters ii ( 1988 ) while not exactly brilliantly well made , are certainly not a waste of celluloid and present entertainment value . then there ' s my favourite martian , the exact opposite of what a movie should be : a hurried , poorly written and acted movie with one goal , to make money . disney , ever since the lion king ( 1994 ) have lost their magic touch , but this dross just shows how far disney have sunk . christopher lloyd plays a martian who crash lands in front of t . v reporter ' s tim o ' hara car ( daniels ) , and soon tim finds the martian in his home , trying to recover and fix his spaceship . along with his ' zoot ' spacesuit , voiced by wayne knight , must fix his spaceship before it explodes , and also try to stop his identity being revealed to the public , firstly by o ' hara , but later by rival t . v presenter brace channing ( hurley ) , by calling himself tim ' s ' uncle martin . ' ' laughter ' is supposed to arise from the ' comical ' events , but never does . many bad films have good intentions , but my favourite martian doesn ' t appear to try to provide any entertainment . filled to the brim with wham bang special effects , my favourite martian offers little more than some nice eye candy . christopher lloyd mugs his way through the entire movie , i ' ve never seen a man pull a face for 93 minutes until now . jeff daniels plays ' staple nice guy ' and his role is useless . his performance is incredibly lazy , although his paperthin character doesn ' t deserve more than the performance he gives . darryl hannah looks as pretty as ever , but her role is somewhat , erm , limited . hurley mistakes ' acting ' for ' shouting and looking like a twit ' and wins the david wilcock award for ' most irritating , godawful performance in a moving picture . ' way to go liz ! for the supporting cast , disney manage to assemble every character actor out there , during the film i was going ' he was the guy in . . . ah . . er . . . ' before finally giving up and switching off . another major setback is the staple ' comedy sidekick . ' unfortunately , the writers ( sherri stoner and deanna oliver , if anyone cares ) forget that a comedy sidekick needs to be ' funny . ' instead , they deliver zoot , the martians deeply unfunny sidekick . although meant to be a manic character no doubt , every line that comes out of his ' neck ' is a dud . a real dud . citizen kane delivers more laughs a minute than his hell spawn piece of polyester . even the kids in the audience were insulted by this character : not one child even bothered to smirk . it ' s a nice special effect , though . another problems with this comedy are the gags themselves . or rather , the lack of them . my favourite martian reaches a new level of toilet humour : it goes past the bowl , down the pipe and into the sewer . now , toilet humour can be funny , as dumb and dumber ( 1994 ) humorously showed . but here , characters farting , belching and almost getting crapped on ( literally ) is not ' amusing . ' it ' s insulting . there ' s one good gag right before the credits , but it appears the guy who wrote that gag tragically died and his unfunny twin continued . either that , or they were hoping that easy to please six year olds wouldn ' t mind the fact that his movie is beaten by men at work in the funny stakes . yes , men at work . yowza ! the fact that a lot of money was pumped into this film , and that they actually got people to agree to be in this film just depresses me even more . there are thousands of brilliant films out there that can ' t get distribution , yet trash like this gets released nation - wide with ease . thankfully , as soon as it makes it ' s money , it will never be seen again , and my favourite martian will end up where the two lead characters do near the end of the movie : down the toilet .\",\n",

he would have gotten away with it if it wasn \\' t for those annoying little kids . \" the kids \" in this film are the three canadians who are terribly underused making their relationship with carter underdeveloped and unbelievable . the lawyers who help release carter also are underused , as is clancy brown as a kind prison guard ( the complete opposite of his character in \" shawshank redemption \" ) . there is a great amount of talent in this supporting cast but it just never appears . hedaya was superb in \" clueless , \" same for david paymer in \" get shorty , \" harris yulin in \" ghostbusters \" and liev schreiber in \" the daytrippers . \" it is a mystery how this many actors signed on to such shallow roles . on the other hand , it is absolutely no mystery why denzel washington agreed to play rubin \" hurricane \" carter . this role is about as far off from shallow as you can get .',\n",

       " (\"at first i was intrigued by the strange cast and odd creatures on the galaxy quest trailer , but that was before i saw the film . now my view has completely changed . it ' s time to embrace for impact , because this is a very bumpy ride . the story begins with the cast of galaxy quest including : jason nesmith ( tim allen ) , alexander dane ( alan rickman ) , gwen demarco ( sigourney weaver ) signing autographs at a convention . they meet fans who dress up in costumes , fans who worship the ground they walk on , and a group of aliens called thermians who believe that they are the ultimate saviors against the dreaded alien colony lead by sarris ( robin sachs ) . of course they are unaware of this until they actually begin performing their duties , and meet the ugly aliens themselves . thus begins the long adventure to help save the thermians . the movie plays like a really bad star trek episode , in fact it ' s worse . i don ' t even think trekkies will appreciate this weak spoof , because quite frankly it ' s just not funny . all the jokes are basically collected observations from the series . one such continuous joke involves a simple crew member who believes he will die in space , because no extra on the tv show ever lives , as proven in the star trek series . creative jokes like this may seem like a clever idea , but not when they are used to death . a person can only take so much . we do not need to be tortured , especially when you have to pay for it . it ' s pretty bad when even tim allen is pitiful . it ' s not like i expected an oscar worthy performance form him , but a few laughs would have been helpful . speaking of acting , 2 fine talents were wasted as well . sigourney weaver was here to show cleavage , well at least it worked . it ' s pretty bad when the only entertaining value of the film is cleavage . it just shows you how disgraceful the film really is . alan rickman however was not so lucky . after his last hit ( dogma ) he embarrasses himself by doing this sloppy mess . it ' s just a shame to see talented actors and actresses throw their ability away . when the film couldn ' t get any worse , thankfully some nice special effects pop up . like many big blockbusters ( armageddon , the haunting to name a few ) they rely heavily on effects to help boost the film ' s box office results . times it works , but unfortunately we have to shell out hard earned money and suffer through this junk . when will it stop ? i am getting tired of being suckered into seeing such trash . it may look fine and dandy , but we need to at least have a story . is that too much to ask ? obviously it is . when galaxy quest finally ends , it literally crash lands . aside from the impressive looking creatures from industrial light and magic , it ' s an embarrassment to the cast , and it ' s embarrassing to the science fiction genre . it ' s not the least bit fun , nor was it entertaining . the only place where this movie belongs is to infinity and beyond .\",\n",

       " (\"you ' ve seen this moment before , recently : a particularly troubled character senses danger of the paranormal kind when the room temperature inexplicably plummets to below freezing . the difference is that when it happens to lili taylor ' s nell in the haunting , we don ' t care . the hero of the sixth sense , a young boy named cole , is a rich creation , and we wish nothing more than for the ghosts who haunt him to take a hike . the seasons have changed since an ex - patient shot jaded child psychologist malcolm crowe ( willis ) in the comfort of his own bedroom . desperate to get his career back on track , even at the expense of his crumbling marriage ( to williams , of rushmore ) , malcolm councils the deeply troubled cole ( osment ) . the preteen displays all the quirks of malcolm ' s would - be killer : scars on his body ; antisocial behaviour ; and the reluctance to reveal a big secret . only after cole is locked in a closet by some bullies ( and hospitalized as a result ) does he divulge to malcolm , in a spine - tingling scene , that he sees dead people walking among us , all the time . malcolm assumes , and given his profession , reasonably so , that cole is schizophrenic , not psychic , but the sincerity in cole ' s anguished confession prevents the doctor from taking drastic measures . he will instead pursue the supernatural angle , becoming a kind of surrogate father to cole ( who lives with his single mother , lynn ( collette ) ) in the process . the sixth sense has more in common with ghost than poltergeist . ( though shyamalan does , somewhat unforgiveably , crib the self - rearranging kitchen business from the latter . ) it ' s far more heartwarming than frightening , and the film would be none the worse for wear without its few pulp shocks . cole attracts the dead for reasons unknown , but they ' re not out to harm him , really - they just want to be heard , even if it means scaring the bejesus out of the innocent gradeschooler . perhaps the apparitions seem more ghastly to us , at first , than they really are because we ' re looking at the situation through the eyes of an eight - year - old . that ' s right : willis , for the first time in years , gives up the spotlight to his costar . we appreciate malcolm ' s domestic dilemma , but we identify with cole , recalling our fears of the bogeyman or the closet monster or the thing under the bed . both actors deliver immensely likable performances , and their dynamic is manifest . willis convinces us that he ' s a doctor , something he was unable to do as a horndog shrink in the overheated color of night . osment is phenomenal , a true professional who resists mugging for the camera like some child stars with too much experience in television commercials do . the sixth sense ( atmospherically shot by the silence of the lambs ' cinematographer , tak fujimoto ) is actually a drama - its spooky , effective ad campaign is misleading . only because i was expecting something different did i notice - rather , feel - the movie ' s running time , which is just shy of two hours . the story unfurls slowly but engrossingly ; its unexpected finish is definitely worth the wait . i ' m not sure said big twist ending is bulletproof , but i admired its audacity .\",\n",

       " (\"notice : this is a review and analysis of exotica . the first part of this piece is the review , the second part contains some analysis of the movie which might be construed as spoilers . if you have not seen the movie and after reading the first part you intend to do so , then save the second part for the discussion afterwards . starring : bruce greenwood , mia kirshner , elias kosteas , don mckellar , arsinee khanijian , sarah polley director : atom egoyan screenplay : atom egoyan exotica is a film that grows on retrospection . exotica keeps the viewer guessing about the relationship between the various characters in the film . all of the people know each other , but apart from that , there seems to be no other reason why to select such set and follow them in this fictional account . the director hints for possible solutions , using a multi - line plot , so popular with critics in mystery train , and used to good advantage by quentin tarantino in pulp fiction . exotica reaches a whole new dimension using this technique . at the end it is surprising to see how well the pieces of the puzzle fit together , in spite their apparent unconnectedness and even misleading features . the out - of - chronological - order technique has become ever so popular , perhaps even de rigueur , for biographical films . similarly , we can now expect to see more movies in the future which will use , to varying extent , converging multiplots . on a first glance , once the multi - plot puzzle in exotica is solved , there seems to be little left to look at . but perceptive minds which take the time to dig further will be rewarded with interesting views on life or rather , commentaries on views of life . exotica is very much worth seeing . it opened to critic ' s praise worldwide ( i first saw it in mexico city , last december ) . in canada , it broke records for a movie of its kind , which prompted the american distributor to go for a wide release . apart from a strong plot , acting is very convincing , and the soundtrack seems as if made for the movie . the spoon - fed - entertainment crowd may not appreciate this movie , and thus it might last little on screen . but if you want to try a movie a cut above the crowd , with an originality that is ever so rare , by all means see exotica . analysis ( * * spoilers * * ahead ) what is behind the complex plot in exotica ? first , a common theme of the quest for gratification by monetary means . the lone tax - auditor , the repressed homosexual pet shop owner , the pregnant woman which runs the nightclub , the rich man which has the club remodeled , the audience at the movie theatre , all use personal wealth to buy palliative relief for the penuries of the soul . . . . then we have the quest for gratification through visual means by most of the same people , including those who sit watching exotica . . . . in that regard exotica stands for onlookers at a nightclub , for the rich man looking through silver mirrors , and poor - rich people looking at other ' s people lives through a silver screen . exotica also stands for unwanted society attention into the lives of other people , such as the tax auditor and the pet shop owner . exotica is the customer agent looking at the pet shop owner , which in turn is looking at the core of the problems between the strip dancer and the tax auditor through the detached eye of a gay person ( no attraction to the strip dancer ) , and only interested on avoiding jail ( no personal relationship with the tax auditor ) . in exotica everybody is watching , and what is worse , everybody knows . second , exotica is about isolated people holding back their feelings ; about people which by voluntary or involuntary means transfer their view of reality to other characters . the strip dancer becomes the proverbial daughter , the dj becomes the proverbial killer by means of breaking the relationship between the father and the proverbial daughter . the niece becomes the baby sitter , the baby sitter becomes the dancer , and the dancer becomes the proverbial daughter . the pet shop owner becomes the proverbial dj , by finding the proverbial daughter . a chain made of real and imagined links coming around full circle , just as everything comes around to a fitting whole at the end of the movie .\",\n",

i \\' m talking about the summer \" blockbusters , \" the \" action thrillers , \" the \" this - obviously - cost - a - lot - so - you - know - everyone \\' s - going - to - go \" explosions , gas threats , flying saucers , and special effects . in the rash of \" my , what big guns you have , but wait ! mine are bigger \" movies , there are also the usual boy - meets - fish - and - saves - environment movies ( or whale , whatever ) , and * this * year , the odd crop of \" save - the - world - from - aliens - or - environment - threats \" offerings . i \\' m talking about the three batmans , the speeds , the terminators , etc . this year i \\' m talking about twister , independence day , the arrival , the rock , mission : impossible , and of course , eraser . here in singapore , as our local movie critics like to whine , we seem to get the pick of the crop of \" my explosion is more real - looking than yours \" movies , but nothing else . mission : impossible opened in our theatres almost as soon as it did in the us . the same goes for eraser , which is unfortunate for arnold schwarzenegger because coming so soon after what time magazine recently called \" mission : unavoidable \" ( on account of its worldwide mega - advertising blitz ) , eraser seems like a cheaper , less thoughtful imitation . that \\' s saying a lot , because mi the movie was already a cheap , thoughtless imitation of its tv originator of the \\' 60s /\\' 70s . in eraser , arnie is a us federal marshall who relocates trial witnesses whose testimonies place their lives in danger . he does this by destroying all evidence of their present existence and re - situating them with new identities . his new case is lee cullen , played by vanessa williams who , unlike all the other scumbags he \\' s ever relocated , is \" an actual , real life honest person . \" because she \\' s so good , and has such nice legs , arnold spends the whole movie trying to protect her , and only uses the opening movie sequence to save robert pastorelli from * his * killers . lee obtains evidence that the high - technology weapons company she works for is secretly selling sophisticated , black - market arms to people with foreign accents and stringy hair . of course , as the formula goes , her revealing this information will destroy the system as we know it because heck , there are people in high places who will go down with this , because yes , this is the biggest conspiracy in the history of the world ( that is , america ) since watergate . in protecting lee , arnold is framed by the mentor - turned - evil robert deguerin , nicely played by james caan , and ends up having to prove that he isn \\' t the one killing the programme \\' s witnesses in addition to making sure lee isn \\' t accidentally torpedo - ed to death by the new , green guns his enemies all have . it \\' s around this time that people in the theatre with me starting humming the mission : impossible theme , because arnie \\' s mission includes breaking into a high - security building to run a disk . i guess i should tell you more about the particular gun everyone in this movie is so antsy about . it \\' s an electro - magnetic pulse gun thing which fires aluminium missiles , and which can see through walls . it has some sort of x - ray vision , so its user can target the victim \\' s heart even from great distances . despite this , which i figure is a pretty cool feature in a gun ( though i \\' m certainly no expert ) , however , arnold , whose own heart is targeted a number of times , * never * goes flying 10 feet backwards with a two - foot missile through his chest like all the others who get shot by this gun . instead he outruns and outsmarts his trackers each time , giving eery and ironic resonance to that terminator line that practically made him famous : \" i \\' ll be back . \" like everyone else in the theater , i left the movie feeling that the trailers had duped me , because they made me want to watch this movie voluntarily . although there is a * lot * of violence in this movie , not to mention mutilation and some bloody tussles with alligators , i recommend this movie to most over - 18s who need some therapeutic mindless action to get over the weirdness of fargo or the hangover effect of leaving las vegas . review \\' s rating system : * wait for the video . * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! * * * pretty good , bring a friend . * * * * amazing , potent stuff . * * * * * perfection . see it twice .',\n",

       " (\"just look back two years ago at the coen brothers ' comedic gem the big lebowski , change the actors , take away the bowling alley , add a record store , and you ' ve got high fidelity ( or maybe the other way around since nick hornby ' s novel high fidelity came first ) . either way , it ' s been done before , a trio of losers cracking jokes and complaining about their failed romances , yet it remains consistently funny . why is this ? maybe because you know your life is much better than this , you know these guys are more pathetic than you are , and you know its ok to laugh at them because they ' re fictional . director stephen frears , possibly not intentionally , has created a movie that makes you feel good about yourself and even that ostensibly no good uncle who watches television twenty four hours a day . when watching high fidelity , expect to laugh at someone else ' s pain , realize what you are laughing at , and then laugh again . i laughed at dick ( todd louiso ) , the shy , timorous , steve buscemi character of lebowski , who seems to know what he is talking about but either can ' t put it into words or is harshly rejected by his friends . i laughed at the john goodman character barry ( jack black ) , an exact replica of the comic bookstore owner on the simpsons , pudgy , egotistic , and obnoxious at the same time . and i laughed at rob ( john cusack ) , the jeff bridges type , whom the story revolves around . rob is the character easiest to relate to , but he is nothing like you at all . he uncontrollably cheats and lies , then is unable to realize why he can not hold onto a woman . and like his other miserable friends , pop music is where he inevitably goes for comfort . he spends the afternoons at his job quizzing his coworkers with obscure trivia or listening to new music and either deriding it or praising it . whatever human emotions the clash , aretha franklin , and bruce springsteen records hold , rob and co . grasp them and help fill voids in their social lives . rob has built an extensive collection in his record store as well as his home and he organizes them depending on what mood he is in . during this confused stage of his life in which the movie focuses on , rob is trying to cope with numerous rejections over the years by visiting past girlfriends and eventually asking why they dumped him . but these aren ' t any girlfriends ? these girls made the all time top five break ups in the history of rob ( rob ' s incessant use of lists show how pop music has played a major role in his life ) . the plot in three words is : women and music . the approach director stephen frears takes by having the charismatic rob speak directly to the camera is very effective . it gives high fidelity a quickly paced , informal structure , adjectives which perfectly parallel rob ' s own lifestyle . it also helps open the viewer ' s eyes as to how annoying barry is . jack black steals the show with a hilariously realistic performance as a total sleaze ball . just listening to him speak for five minutes makes the audience immediately sympathetic for rob , who must work with him every day of the week . what frears does so well is that he makes us feel sorry for rob while laughing at his misfortunes . john cusack plays his character convincingly but it is the strong supporting cast , consisting of big stars and character actors , that really defines rob . now instead of rob just talking to the camera , after he explains something , the remaining cast members physically and humorously create what he is trying to say . the only problem with high fidelity is that it doesn ' t end when it should have ended . instead the movie goes on for a torturous twenty minutes that seem a lot longer than that . also bruce springsteen is completely wasted in a brief cameo halfway through the movie . high fidelity is a cheerful , old fashioned comedy with a voluminous soundtrack and as many laughs . i just hope hollywood keeps creating losers on the big screen , they make everyone look and feel great .\",\n",

       " ('i \\' m an avid fan of the \" alien \" saga , so this review is obviously a tad biased ( at least i admitted it ) . of course , that doesn \\' t mean that i \\' m gonna be giving this a four - star review or something , because \" alien : resurrection , \" the fourth film in the cool - as - hell series is not an absolutely amazing film , much like the first two were . however , it \\' s a very good film which never fails to entertain , and consists of yet another mutation in the style of the series . in short , i had a good time . \" alien : resurrection \" leaves off 200 years after the last one , where our heroine protagonist , ellen ripley ( sigourney weaver ) , the science fiction genre \\' s answer to job , had killed herself after discovering that an alien was inside her body , waiting to pop out like it did to john hurt in the first one . of course , the last one wasn \\' t very great or anything ( i liked it , though not as much as the first two ) , and more importantly , it wasn \\' t financially successful ( a tawdry 55 million bucks ! ) . so back we are , with ripley back as a clone , which means we get another little satirical look at cloning ( not that that \\' s a bad thing , but it \\' s becoming a cliche ) . so she \\' s cloned aboard an even more futuristic - looking ship called \" the auriga \" by some doctors ( including the necessary bad government guy , dr . wren , played by j . e . freeman , as well as the little - seen dr . gediman , played by none other than brad douriff ) , mainly because they have a version of her with the alien still inside her . once you get past the fact that you can \\' t figure out where they got her blood ( although i think it might have been from the blood samples taken by charles dance in the third one ) , the film \\' s okay . also on board are a band of mercenary pirates , including michael wincott , ron perlman , kim flowers , raymond cruz , dominique pinon ( a jeunet sytable ) and . . . winona ryder , who plays analee call , who turns out to have a bit of a secret ( i won \\' t state it , but unless you \\' ve been shacking up with salinger for the past two years , you probably know all about it - although it \\' s nicely covered up ) . there \\' s a bit of a non - sexual - yet - slightly - homoerotic relationship between her and ripley , but it \\' s never really deepened enough . oh well . well , as you might have guessed , the alien and its spawn escape and run around the ship . and it pretty much does away with most of the people on the ship ( including some shocks - dan hedaya , for instance , who \\' s death is comical yet sad since , well , he \\' s dan hedaya ) , and the remaining people ( about 7 or 8 ) are left to try and escape and stop the aliens from doing any major harm since the ship is heading quickly towards earth . of course , the plot is all balderdash , and just an excuse for some good old \" alien \" - brand fun . the real focus of the series seems to be on style , not really substance ( although there \\' s always a bit of it , most notably in \" aliens \" with the relationship between ripley and the little girl ) . what \\' s interesting about the series is that each film is stylistically different in its approach . \" alien \" is a claustrophobic exercise in quiet frights . \" aliens \" is a wild , tense thriller . \" alien 3 \" is a bleak , moody piece of semi - noir . \" alien 4 \" is kind of like an off - beat french film , filled with lots of humor , and cool scares . jean - pierre jeunet ( without his usual directing partner , marc caro ) creates a ship filled with the kind of scares films like \" das boot \" has , with echoes hinting at a possible threat . the chills in the film are really cool , especially with the music , which is sometimes turned down completely for certain scenes ( there \\' s the most tense surgery scene since \" face / off \" towards the beginning ) . and not every chill turns into a bloody mess or anything like that . this all combined with some good old humor makes this as interesting visually and stylistically as the others . there are even a couple scenes which just stick out afterwards as being brilliantly executed . one is the aforementioned surgery scene . another one takes place between call and ripley , which is just awesome . the underwater chase scene and the ladder scene afterwards is one of the most tense , thrilling , and jaw - dropping scenes in the entire saga ( with a small allusion to jeunet \\' s earlier film , \" delicatessen \" ) . and the way they do in the final alien is hysterically cool ( with a lovely allusion to \" goldfinger \" ) . but the best scene in the entire film ( i \\' m sure i \\' m not the first to mention it ) takes place when ripley sees all the variations on her as they cloned her ( she has a an \" 8 \" tatooed on her arm ) . it might be the most emotionally stimulating scene in the entire saga . the screenplay by joss whedon is not a great piece of work , as it never really deapens a lot of the characters . however , it does make us care about most of them , so that when there \\' s very little of them , and it looks like one or more of them may become alien chow , we are pretty scared . and , yeah , there are some very funny lines ( ripley : \" who do i have to fuck to get off this boat ? ! \" johner : \" well , i can get you off . but not this ship . \" ) the acting is good all around , with stand - out performances from ron perlman as the male chauvenist pig johner , and leland orser ( the poor bastad in \" se7en \" who performed the \" lust \" sin ) as an anxiety - ridden wannabe woody allen who has an alien inside him . winona ryder is good , but not amazing like she usually is ( although she meshes well with the film ) . of course , and as usual , sigourney weaver steals the show . playing a variation on the ripley character ( less emotional , and more rude and bitter ) , she pulls it off while still being utterly lovable . she \\' s not going to get an oscar nomination like she did for \" aliens , \" but she \\' s just awesome . overall , it \\' s a thrilling , entertaining film which doesn \\' t really amaze like the first two , but is much more amazing than the third installment . the style is the best part of the film , which isn \\' t really a bad thing , but it being the best part takes away from a lot of the depth the film occasionally tries to apply . but it \\' s entertaining as hell , and it \\' s definitely fit for the \" alien \" series .',\n",

what is thought ? who are we ? if these were answered , this film would be the greatest science fiction ever made . they are off course not answered , but posed in an intelligent manner . the visual aspect of the film is one of the key elements , since it portrays the contrast between these computer - simulated universes . kirk m . petrucelli has done a marvelous job with the recreation of the thirties with its glamour , grace and color ; and setting this world in opposition to our own -- an almost caricatured recreation of the nineties . there are some honest and decent performances by an almost unknown cast and harald klose \\' s moody musical score that is at in right place at the right time . a rather unusual thing about \\' the thirteenth floor \\' is the almost complete lack of special effects . there are no cgi animated creatures , no bullets in slow motion . this is a more philosophical approach , reminding about the european way of filmmaking . this is off course a major disappointment to the audience that is used to endless gunfights and mutated amphibians , but the more serious science fiction buffs and \\' dark city \\'- fans will be pleased . this film is interesting and inspiring . it has everything existenz doesn \\' t , but it lacks the immediacy and intensity of the matrix . and then there is a happy end which , like in \\' dark city \\' , completely alienates it from the rest of the story and context . the plot itself is not as original as the filmmakers want us to think , since they have virtually sucked out all information from the best science fiction classics , including blade runner and \\' dark city \\' . with this in mind , \\' the thirteenth floor \\' doesn \\' t make an oscar candidate or a film that will be remembered a year from now , yet this is a beautiful , elegant and intelligent take on virtual reality .',\n",

( one of which makes an interesting statement : pay attention to the film \\' s opening shot and watch where it is repeated . ) we first glimpse the dalai lama when he is two years old . his curiosity and self - assuredness capture the attention of a monk wandering in search of the new lama . a test is arranged to see if this boy really is the reincarnation of the 13 dalai lamas who have gone before . several items belonging to the previous dalai lama are laid before the boy alongside some other items . the child is asked if he recognizes any of the items as his own . the boy picks correctly , proving that he is the new , and the old , dalai lama . scorsese and long - time editor thelma schoonmaker were kind enough to allow the possibility that the child was taking his cues from the monk . before selecting an item , he would look at the monk , perhaps for some sort of confirmation . sometimes he picked right the first time , and sometimes he made a second choice . either way , whether through reincarnation or quick human perception , the tibetans were assured of choosing a boy who could be a wise , perceptive leader . > from this point on , the boy is raised as the reincarnation of the lama \\' s spirit and the future leader of a nation . it is a great weight to put on the mind of a child . in the u . s . it might be grounds for a call to social services . but the young lama accepts his destiny without any apparent emotional damage . neither the great power nor the awesome responsibility keeps him from becoming a genuinely likeable , well - rounded person . certain patterns take shape over the years . for example , the dalai lama is fascinated by technology . radios , clocks , and telescopes are some of his favorite toys . when he is old enough to accept his leadership , he makes plans to modernize isolated tibet . he also has a soft spot for creatures who are suffering or in pain , including herd animals . it \\' s nearly a running gag that he will buy sheep to keep them from being herded to slaughter . but the most ominous constant throughout his life is the presence and threat of tibet \\' s gigantic neighbor , china . tibet and its leaders prove correct in fearing china , as , first the propaganda , then the political pressure , and finally the armies , come across their common border . the chinese invasion is so successful that the lama \\' s life is in danger if he stays . the movie ends when , after much agonizing , the dalai lama leaves tibet for india . the story doesn \\' t lead up to a cinematic climax as strongly as most feature films do . it just doesn \\' t fit that mold . if it were forced into such a shape it would have been a completely different movie ( perhaps more like seven years in tibet , which is good in its own right ) . the pacing of kundun is more calm and level than that . the structure of the film is made to fit the characters and events , not vice - versa . perhaps because the pace is slower , we have more time to notice the beautiful art , vestments , and architecture of tibet . a mandala , ( tibetan sand painting ) with beautiful , vibrant colors is shown throughout the movie . the robes and hats of state are bright red and gold . the bricks are a rich reddish brown , not unlike the skin tone of the tibetans . even the touchstone pictures logo before the movie ( which is usually light blue ) is the red and gold of tibet . philip glass composed the music for kundun , and he was the perfect choice . for those who don \\' t know of glass , his music is like a tibetan mandala . his building blocks are lots of small notes , tiny grains of music , which are first grouped , then repeated in patterns . these patterns create interesting textures which are themselves part of a larger composition . people won \\' t be flocking to kundun for it \\' s great ending , or talking about its outstanding plot , but it does have a lot to offer : an interesting lifetime , exotic sights , rich cinematography , and innovative music . it gives interesting insight into tibetan buddhism and takes a warm look at the dalai lama as a person . on top of it all is the cinematic mastery of martin scorsese , who gives the film a strong , beautiful , consistent look .',\n",

       " ('you don \\' t look at a ren ? magritte painting and search for a deeper meaning . you likewise don \\' t look at one for 88 minutes straight . surrealist works are notable for their quirks , and they are fun , but looking at one quirk for an hour and a half is exhausting . that was my experience with i woke up early the day i died , a surrealistic , hyperactive comedy with no dialogue . it \\' s not a silent movie ; there is lots of atmospheric music , occasional screams and weird sound effects , but nobody ever utters an audible word . though the film is distinctive , its unique style wore thin after about 20 minutes , and as it progressed , watching became a chore . the only reason the script ever got filmed is because it was written by the pseudo - legendary ed wood , the man behind such \" classics \" as plan 9 > from outer space and night of the ghouls . the joke , of course , is that his films are so bad , they \\' re good ; so humorous in their inanity that they become hits . i woke up early the day i died , unfortunatly , is so bad that it \\' s really bad . it stars billy zane ( titanic ) as a dangerous lunatic who overpowers a nurse , escapes from a mental hospital and proceeds to wonder around , stealing a car , clothes , and a load of money . our thief reaches a cemetery , where he witnesses a bizarre ritual . he falls asleep and finds himself , literally , in a hole , with his money gone . for whatever reason , he is bent on getting his hard - unearned cash back ( considering how easily he stole it the first time , why didn \\' t he just go steal some more ? ) . he comes upon a list of the people who were at the mysterious ceremony and commences to seek out each of them and kill them if they don \\' t have what he is looking for . i don \\' t think either director aris iliopulos nor ed wood realized that this would have made a glorious 20 minute short . the subject and the style seem to have been made for it . unfortunately , twenty minutes worth of material is stretched out to more than four times that length , and the film simply overstays its already dubious welcome . it grabbed my attention in the beginning and gradually lost it as it went on , up to the point where halfway through i was already weary . it might seem odd that a film as furiously paced as this one can be so tedious ; but the surprise will wear off when you consider how repetitive it is . i woke up early the day i died is a comedy , i guess , though it could have fooled me . unlike most ed wood films , this one tries to be funny and fails , instead of the other way around . there \\' s nothing inherently wrong with that , in fact , i think it would only make sense for someone who has been so \" good \" at making unintentional comedies to take a stab at a real one . whether wood actually went for comedy in his script we \\' ll never know , but in either case , this is a failure . jonathan taylor thomas , christina ricci , summer phoenix , john ritter and others show up for short and pointless cameos . ricci , for example , plays a prostitute . her role consists of dancing around with zane in his motel room and then being thrown out . thomas is an astonished onlooker as a woman gets thrown off a cliff . was the home improvement teen heartthrob really that desperate for work ? zane , meanwhile , occupies himself by making weird faces at the camera when he is not called upon to run around wildly and beat people up . lack of dialogue makes him the ultimate caricature . the carnival side - show climax manages to demonstrate everything that is wrong with this no - budget production . it \\' s desperately unfunny , but thinks it \\' s the funniest thing since plan 9 ; , it \\' s so spontaneously surrealistic it makes your head spin all while being confusing enough to make your head spin twice as fast in the other direction . i hope another film is made from an ed wood screenplay for i woke up early the day i died is not a fitting send - off . ? 1999 eugene novikov &# 137 ;',\n",

       " (\"in the grand scheme of mel gibson movies , payback was better than conspiracy theory , but not as good as braveheart or lethal weapon . in other words , it ' s a decent couple of hours of entertainment , but 20 years from now if a they compile a list of mel gibson ' s greatest hits , payback probably won ' t be on it . gibson plays a crook who gets double crossed by his partner after they heist a payroll . mel ' s partner needed the money to pay off a mob debt . so he puts a couple of bullets in mel , leaving him for dead , and goes on to pay off his creditors . but , mel isn ' t dead ( it would be a real short movie if he was ) and he certainly isn ' t happy . to make matters worse , he wants his money back and is willing to go to any lengths to accomplish this feat . his ex partner has already used it to pay off the mobsters , so mel goes after the mob to get it back . payback is often a very violent film . to its credit , there are a few scenes that could have been very graphic , but the director ( i ' m not sure which one -- more about that in a second ) made the choice to let the audience use their imagination instead of subjecting us to the usual gratuitous gore found in many films . the film appears a bit disjointed in places , which is understandable considering producer / star gibson wasn ' t thrilled with how the film turned out and wanted parts of it re - shot . when the director refused , another one was brought in to do the re - shoot . so as a result while the final product is apparently better than the original ( although personally i would love to see the original version for comparisons sake ) it does get a bit of a choppy feel to it towards the end . it ' s always tough to make a film where the main character is a villain , unless that person has some redeeming qualities . in this case , gibson ' s character has few redeeming qualities . but hey , its mel , so even when he is killing people in cold blood we are still rooting for him . my guess is that if that you put some other johnny bananas actor in this role , the audience would not be quite as responsive . gibson is gibson , whether he is playing a suicidal cop or a stone cold killer , he does a good job . he almost guarantees that no matter what else happens in the rest of the movie at least the audience is going to get one good performance . this time out mel is surrounded by a good supporting cast , including maria bello ( as his love interest ) , william devane and kris kristofferson ( as mod bosses ) . the man who steals the show and unfortunately doesn ' t have a real big part is james coburn ( as yet another mobster ) . if i had one big disappointment in this film , it would be that coburn didn ' t have a bigger role . in the end , payback is a fairly solid action thriller , just not in quite the same league as some of mel gibson ' s other work .\",\n",

       " ('here is a film that is so unexpected , so scary , and so original that it caught me off guard and threw me for a loop . okay , it isn \\' t quite original , considering it is a sequel to the box office hit species , but it certainly is smart . most films of this genre are reminiscent of those cheesy b - horror films from the 50s and 60s , and some even become them . however , as we learned with the 1995 small - budget horror / sci - fi film , sometimes expectations can be shattered . a lot of criticism has gone against this film ( from what i have read so far , anyway -- yep , all two reviews ) , and it makes me wonder why these types of films are automatically dismissed as gory , laughable pieces of trash . but , the thing is , it isn \\' t . it \\' s well made , well acted , and quite intelligent . i can see most of the critics now complaining about the level of gore or the level of sexuality in the film . but the species series isn \\' t about the lack of these elements . it \\' s about how much it can get into one film . and yet , behind it all , it has this basic premise that allows it to get away with doing so . species ii begins in the present day , though it seems to be an alternate universe . many films ( especially sci - fi ones ) create similar timelines as our realistic one , but change it to fit the film \\' s needs . species ii begins with the arrival of an american spacecraft , the excursion , landing on the surface of mars . aboard is patrick ross ( justin lazard ) , a very bright and very handsome astronaut . patrick is the son of senator ross ( james cromwell ) , who just wants patrick to succeed . well , it would seem that he has succeeded . landing on the surface of mars , he is the first human being to ever do so . of course , he isn \\' t the first ever . about a billion years ago , an alien species supposedly landed on mars and destroyed the perfect living conditions that were able to sustain life . now , of course , the red planet is cold and rocky . no life lives on it . that is , no visible life . patrick , upon leaving the spacecraft and landing on the red soil , collects samples from the ground . he takes them aboard , and puts them in storage . unfortunately , one of the samples contains a form of life , and it gets loose when it is heated aboard the ship . just prior to heading back to earth , this life form creeps along the floor and inhabits the earthlings . they pass out for approximately seven minutes , and then shrug it off as nothing , because they can \\' t even remember . they blame it on a technical malfunction . back on earth , patrick begins to have strong urges to mate with as many women as possible . as we know from the original , this is because the alien wants to breed and take over the planet . however , the children that are bred are half - human , as their father is . patrick is really looking for another alien to breed with , and he finds it in eve ( natasha henstridge ) . eve was cloned from dna taken from sil , the original alien . however , this time around , most of her \" alien \" urges have been either decreased dramatically , or lie dormant . the project is led by dr . laura baker ( marg helgenberger , reprising her role from species ) , and her motives seem respectable . since she was involved with the original alien attack , she wants to learn how to stop the alien should it come again . and it has . story - wise , species ii is much stronger than its predecessor , but it is also much stronger than , say , aliens ( hey , i love the film , but you can \\' t tell me it was strong on story ) . what surprised me the most with this film was the incorporation of historical facts into the screenplay . in my search for extraterrestrial intelligence course in college , we learned about a piece of rock from mars which landed in one of the poles . this piece of rock contained fossils which may have been proof of life on mars ( later , it was proven that it was not a living creature that created it ) . the script uses this effectively , but also manages to provide a well - balanced plot . beginning with the first man on mars ( something i have always dreamed of seeing ) , i was hoping that the film would turn this element into a useful starting point for the movie . and it does it quite well . the characters are all smart , and they know what to do and what not to do . the only character that seems a little cliched is the general ( george dzundza ) , and yet , he remains logical in everything he does . there are the obvious flaws of course , mostly lying in the technical aspects . the special effects are only mediocre , and some are just plain bad . but for the most part , they remain believable ( i even noticed a homage to the alien series when the mothers gave birth to alien children ) . also , the most realistic ones are usually the goriest , ranging from people being torn open , or someone \\' s head being blown off . however , some plot elements also may elicit laughs from the audience , including a menage a troi that is all but necessary . many people dislike the species series because all it is is an excuse for sex , nudity , and gory violence . however , i tend to disagree . what were the alien films about ? and , if an alien species ever did come to earth , and their sole purpose was to destroy us , wouldn \\' t you mate as quickly as possible with as many people as possible ? my only gripe with this is during the scene where patrick goes searching for a mate in a grocery store . i didn \\' t realize that aliens were that picky on choosing women to mate with ( i just assume it is his part - human side looking for the most beautiful one ) . the acting is quite good for this kind of film . it is a vast improvement over the first film , at least . the acting is the key element to this film : if it was bad , it would have lowered itself into camp ; if it was good , it would have asked for comparison with films like aliens . okay , so it isn \\' t that good . george dzundza is probably the most obvious mistake on casting , as his over - the - top impersonation of a general makes him annoying and distracting . natasha henstridge is limited this time around , as she is usually enclosed in a cage . however , she does manage a very impressive performance with this aspect hindering any of her talent . oh yeah , and she \\' s quite fun to just plain watch . marg helgenberger is immensely better this time around , and her performance is probably the best in this film . michael madsen is so - so , but he isn \\' t annoying , and he soon becomes rather appealing ( with his nice cynic personality ) . james cromwell has a small part , but he makes it much better than what it could have been with a more incapable actor . as i say , any film with james cromwell dramatically increases in likeability . mykelti williamson gives an enjoyable performance , and he gives the film a more down - to - earth feel . and , of course , justin lazard . lazard has so far been ridiculed for his performance , but i think he is effective . sure , he is wooden , but isn \\' t that what his character is like ? the moment when he touches the glass separating henstridge from him was extremely well done , due to the couple \\' s acting . species ii is rated r for strong sexuality , sci - fi violence / gore and language . this is definitely an r rated film that young kids should not see . more than likely , they would probably have nightmares and never have sex for the rest of their lives . hell , i don \\' t even know if i will . what is sure to be a critically lambasted film turns out to be the surprise film of the year . i probably won \\' t see another film where i was expecting so little and got so much for quite a while . director peter medak has crafted a very suspenseful , and sometimes very scary movie out of a mediocre series . medak has also mastered the wonderful \" jump ! \" moments , and has probably the second scariest moment i have ever seen on film ( scream still has the first ) . strong acting , smart dialogue , intelligent plotting , and a sure - handed director , species ii is exactly what these films should be : entertaining .',\n",

       " (\"vannesa kensington : ` austin , do you smoke after sex ? ' austin powers : ` i don ' t know baby , i ' ve never looked ! ' and so begins our journey into the most anticipated sequel of the summer season . austin powers 2 , the sequel to the sleeper hit of 1997 , is filled to the brim with uproarious sight gags and lurid toilet jokes that will make you keel over with hilarity . the mind of mike myers is obviously a very bizarre place . myers returns as the swinging 60 ' s spy and his arch - nemesis , the bald headed dr . evil , who is given much of the spotlight here . there ' s an early scene in which dr . evil and his son scott ( seth green ) appear on a jerry springer segment entitled ` my dad is evil and wants to take over the world ' , hosted by springer himself . most of these talk - show gags , spoofing everything from oprah to regis and kathie lee , are no longer as funny as they once were . happily , this is an exception , especially when a fight breaks out between dr . evil and the other guests . ( sample dialogue - ` come back here you mother #@%$^ ! ! you want a piece of me ? ' ) the audience was in stitches . there are many good things about this sequel . dr . evil is now assisted by mini - me ( verne troyer ) , a pint - sized clone who is the result of an experiment gone awry . mini - me is the most perfect new character that any fan could ask for , and troyer does a terrific job of mimicking everything that his big brother does , pinkie and all . mindy sterling returns as frau farbissina , evil ' s loud - mouth assassin sidekick , and here we are treated to a brief romantic liaison between the two in an underground bedroom chamber . this works surprisingly well . afterward , there ' s even a meeting at the coffee machine , where their awkwardness is expressed in a scene you would expect in any normal office environment . oh , yes . . . the plot . after a short honeymoon with vanessa kensington ( elizabeth hurley ) that goes disastrously wrong , powers is back on the case to thwart the diabolical plans of dr . evil . in the original , the subject of the day was cryogenic freezing that enabled the characters to hop between two time periods . here , it ' s time travel . dr . evil has this crazy plan to steal austin ' s mojo ( the source of his sexual powers ) , so he jumps through a time portal back into 1969 when powers is still is his freezing chamber . there , he employs a grotesque 600 - pound scottish assassin named fat bastard ( also myers ) to commandeer the mojo , so that our future hero is left completely shagless . meanwhile , austin is informed of evil ' s wrong - doing by basil exposition ( michael york ) , and is supplied with his very own time - traveling device in the form of a volkswagen beetle . once back in 1969 , powers meets a foxy cia operative named felicity shagwell ( heather graham ) , and learns of dr . evil ' s plans to destroy washington dc with a lazer on the moon . in one of the many uproarious jabs at star wars , evil calls the moon base a ` death star ' . if there ever was a movie that knew from the start it was a complete joke , it ' s austin powers : the spy who shagged me . ap2 has many hilarious moments , much more so , than the original austin powers . but what it doesn ' t have is the confident support system that the first boasted , and the jokes are now more scattershot and hit - and - miss . while myers has a knack for delivering clever , inspired gags , he sometimes doesn ' t know when to call it quits . the hilarious scene in the original involving mustafa ( will ferrell ) and his refusal to die is played out here in a disappointing and tired manner . robert wagner , as dr . evil ' s # 2 man , has only one scene early on in the film , where he lacks all the focus of the character . one nice surprise is rob lowe , as the young # 2 , who patterns wagner ' s voice and movements right down to a tee . there are more recycled jokes from the predecessor , including kristen johnston as ivana humpalot ( an unfunny rendition of alotta fagina ) . but myers has clearly put so much dedication into this project , and many bits are side - splittingly funny . don ' t miss an extended visual gag in a tent , where the shadows leave much to the imagination . . . . of the new characters , graham doesn ' t leave much of an impression . her performance is merely okay , and she lacks the gung - ho enthusiasm that made elizabeth hurley so enjoyable before her . and as for fat bastard . . . well , he provides one or two hilarious moments , but all of the obesity jokes and bathroom talk go too far . but my most severe complaint : mr . bigglesworth was only in one scene ! ! but , with gritted teeth , i managed to get over that . this sequel will not leave fans disappointed ; it ' s more often than not a laugh riot . and , i look optimistically to the future , where i foresee more installments to the austin powers collection . if myers can up the quota of fresh ideas , we should be in store for much more .

       " ('i read the new yorker magazine and i enjoy some of their really in - depth articles about some incident . they will take some incident like the investigation of a mysterious plane crash and tell you what happened in detail . it becomes a real education in what agencies get involved and how theories are suggested , and what kind of pressure the investigators are under , and just about any other aspect you can think of . frequently i get the feeling that the article sounded exciting , but i am being told in more detail than i really wanted to know . often i get to the middle of a story and say , ok , it sounded good but i now have invested more time than i am willing to spend on this subject . film is a different medium . it is a visual medium . that slows down the telling of stories much more than people realize . i frequently am surprised to find out how short a film script is and how much of the pages are empty space . the magazine article and the film script are two very different media . the insider is a film adaptation of the vanity fair article \" the man who knew too much \" by marie brenner . it is too much an adaptation of a magazine article slowed to the pace of a film . it really verges on being tedious at least at times . for years the seven big companies knew that they dealt in an addictive drug that caused a host of unhealthy side - effects . but they pretended for the public that it was unproven and they did not really believe it . the business was incredibly profitable and the proceeds translated into the political power to squelch and discredit any political movements against big tobacco . the tide turned when a former vice - president of one of the companies was convinced by the cbs 60 minutes news team to tell the public how much the tobacco companies really knew about the health effects of smoking . the resulting pressure to stop the story created a small civil war at cbs . who were the major people involved , what were their motives , how was the story almost killed , how did it get aired anyway ? that is the story covered in surprising detail by the insider . this all could have been enthralling , but it is not the sort of thing that a stylist like michael mann would be likely to do well . and in the end , he failed . to make a long story short , the film needed a director who knew how to make a long story short . the film opens with the cbs 60 minutes team in iran with the assignment to interview a terrorist . we get a taste for their personal style and how they get the upper hand . they go from being one newsman blindfolded at the hands of the terrorists to the actual interview with mike wallace ( played by christopher plummer ) . there the news team under producer lowell bergman ( al pacino ) are ordering around the terrorists and getting away with it . this seems to have nothing to do with the main line of the story , but later when the tobacco industry is so much harder to manipulate than committed terrorists , we have a wry irony on who really has clout in the world . terrorists can grab the headlines , but the tobacco companies have the real position of power . incongruously intercut with the iran interview sequence we see jeffrey wigand ( russell crowe ) dejectedly returning from work to his home . we discover that he has been fired and his career brought to a complete halt unexpectedly . he had been a very profitably rewarded vice - president in charge or research and development at brown and williams tobacco ; now he was unemployed and needed money to support his family . rather than support him his wife liane ( diane venora ) demands of him what are they supposed to do for income . meanwhile the 60 minutes team trying to do a story on fires started by cigarettes have obtained some data they do not understand . they offer wigand $ 12 , 000 just to interpret the data . wigand \\' s severance agreement swears him to secrecy about anything he knows about tobacco dealings , but he is reluctantly he stretches the severance terms . he is willing to read some documents from another tobacco company and interpret them for bergman . in spite of the secrecy , wigand \\' s former employers seem immediately to know wigand is talking to 60 minutes and he is warned off by former boss thomas sandefur played michael gambon in an all too brief but deliciously sinister role . and so the game begins . wigand is irate at his negative treatment for what he still considered continued to be loyalty to his agreement and his former employer . meanwhile someone is playing very rough with wigand and his family . the film examines wigand and the pressures placed on his family as they are caught between two powerful giants . wigand has always wanted to make tobacco safer and has natural sympathies with getting the story out . he and his family are assaulted psychologically and financially by the giant tobacco industry that had never lost a legal fight . al pacino is given top billing but the wigand family is the core of the insider . the story is told slowly and in just a bit too much meticulous detail . the film is 157 minutes and is an extremely demanding film for the audience . the musical score by pieter bourke , lisa gerrard , and graeme revell is one of the worst in recent memory . it puts ominous chords under some scenes and using voice in ways that become a distraction that gets in the way of the storytelling . also disturbing is the casting of christopher plummer as mike wallace . plummer and wallace are such different types and wallace is too well - known for even so good an actor as plummer to play him convincingly . this film might have been a really engaging experience under another director \\' s control . michael mann was the wrong person to helm this film and the insider lacks intensity because of his style . i rate it a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the - 4 to + 4 scale .',\n",

moving , meticulous film , that grabs hold of you by the collar and never lets go . the force of what is seen , though filmed in an objective manner , never taking a cheap shot at the hasidim , is nevertheless bound to leave questions about the nature of such a practice of strict observance . the film is meant to be critical of such a rigid people , as it implies how they kill the spirit of everything they touch and with their extreme phobic attitudes , it makes it impossible for them to unite the country when they can \\' t at present live in harmony with their own people , and it would be even more impossible to imagine them living with their arab neighbors in peace . the film opens as meir rises at dawn and goes through his prayer ritual , where every prayer is made to the virtues of god . he even thanks god that he didn \\' t make him a woman . his wife rivka accepts the fate she was born into and looks at him from the next bed where she sleeps separately according to hasidic custom . she looks at him with glistening eyes , not questioning the laws or rebelling against her secondary role and how her religion keeps her from studying the talmud and having all the modern conveniences of life , and from seeing movies and tv . meir is a talmudic scholar . his father ( abu warda ) is a rabbi at the yeshiva . he has been married for ten years and his wife has not been able to give him a child . since the hasidim look upon a woman \\' s role in life being only to conceive children , and cook and clean house for the man , while the man \\' s role is to spend his time in prayer , therefore there is an insurmountable problem in this otherwise loving marriage . she receives an anonymous letter that states \" a woman without a child is no better than dead . \" meir \\' s response , is that it is written like that in the talmud . meir \\' s father tells him that the marriage contract must be broken : \" a man who dies without progeny rips a page from the torah . \" all the blame is placed on rivka , who is thought of as unpure as the reason for her being barren . she will go through countless ritual baths to cleanse herself , as her rigid mother ( koenig ) dunks her in the holy water and says a ritual prayer for the 12 times she is dunked as an homage to the 12 tribes of israel . their religion doesn \\' t permit them to be examined extensively by a doctor . rivka goes on the sly and finds out that it is her husband who is sterile , but she cannot tell him that because of their religion . so when meir \\' s father chooses a younger woman for his son , she is exiled to live alone in a cold apartment in the same jewish quarters . rivka \\' s spirited younger sister malka does not want to get married but wants to live a more liberated life . she has a long time romantic relationship with a fellow hasidic yaakov . but , because of the way they were both raised , she is still a virgin . when yaakov joined the israeli army to fight in lebanon , something his sect is not allowed to do , he is thereby banished from the sect even though he is still a believer . he now works as a singer in a nightclub . malka \\' s mother is worried that her daughter won \\' t get married , so she arranges with the rabbi for her to marry yossef , someone whom she doesn \\' t love . yossef is a very stern follower of the order , he is also a political activist who drives around the city in a sound - truck with a bull - horn urging jews to stick together and fight their godless enemies . the two sisters are close and languidly discuss their options , with rivka telling her sister to accept the marriage , it will make her happy ; but , while malka is reluctantly forced into accepting it , she has other plans to ruin this bogus marriage . the harshest scene in the film is on malka \\' s wedding night . yossef prays to god for a child and then robotically gets malka to spread her legs , and without the least bit of affection , only a nervousness shown on his part for the function he supplies , as he goes inside her and rams her hard , thrusting away until the act is completed and then retiring without a word or gesture of love . the sisters have choices , like everyone else in life does . but the choices are obliterated by one \\' s beliefs , circumstances , and inward nature , and how difficult it is to carry out those choices if it goes completely against the way one is brought up . for the sisters , the choices are life or death ones . gitai by closing in on the daily rituals , tight living quarters and close - knit community , has shown how difficult these choices are for those who have never seen another world and have been kept in the dark all their life . the film ends with the forlorn malka walking atop of jerusalem and looking down upon it as an outsider would , and everything seems strange to her , all the things she once thought of as being set in stone are now harsh memories , as she has made her choice , and the price of that choice is very heavy indeed .',\n",

       " (\"well there goes another one . sadly this like other movies this year wasn ' t good . this one being almost as bad as ' the omega code ' but not quite . from the opening credits i had a good feeling this would be bad , and well i guess i was right . with bad excuses for acting , a horrible screenplay and straight - out bad direction ' the bachelor ' is a terribly unfunny movie that doesn ' t work on any levels accept that fact that rene zellwegar who does give a good performance . the two cameos by brooke shields and mariah carey are also good with brooke being the best . the movie is troubled from the start because chris o ' donnell is hugely miscast and gives one of the worst performances to date . here is the stupid plot : chris o ' donnell plays jimmie shelton a man who has just broken up with his girlfriend , he meets anne ( rene zellwegar ) they instantly hit it off and are together for three years . jimmie decides that he wants to bring their relationship a little bit up . he really doesn ' t realize that anne thinks he wants to marry her ( what he wants i never did catch ) . so he proposes in a really bad way , and she shoots him down and is very mad . he of course tries to apologize but nothing seems to help any . then his grandfather dies and he learns that he has left jimmie 100 million dollars . . . . as long as he marries before the next day at 6 : 05 pm . now jimmie must find anne and try to marry her to get the money and because he loves her , or get married to someone else to get the money itself , leading to an un - funny and predictable ending that leaves a bad taste in our mouths . ok so maybe this could be one of the dumbest , cliched , silliest romantic comedy to date that has no real big laughs . even the supporting roles of artie lange , hal holbrook and ed anser aren ' t even good . the plot was a good idea , but the script would have to have been written in less than five minutes and by a five year old . the choppy dialogue and bad directing don ' t help things any . even though chris o ' donnell gave an ok performance in the two batman movies , he does not give even a remotely good or funny performance here and i wanted to boo and throw my pop at the screen to get rid of him . rene zelweggar is a different story and gave a charming , sweet and likable performance ( as usual ) and really was the only thing that saved this confused movie from being a total huge washout . her sister played by marley shelton is also good and the two have good chemistry onscreen . brooke shields showed up in a funny little performance as a big - headed mogul who after a while became routine and old . one really can ' t help but think that we have seen this stuff before . it ' s not like this is an original idea and in the end , everyone knows what is going to happen due do its cliches and typicalness . ' the bachelor ' works on no good levels and in fact doesn ' t work at all . ed anser and hal holbrook were wasted in terrible roles and mariah carey can not act to save her soul , and this could be the only film of her movie career dispite her terrific music career . chris o ' donnell is not as bad an actor as casper van dien but that is not saying a great deal . he seems held back and really doesn ' t get into his character much and after even the first 30 minutes gets annoying and old . artie lange just to me seems like he is trying to another chris farley and was completely unfunny and un - nerving . why the filmmakers would want to waste such a cast in such a bad movie , with such bad acting and dialogue is a question only they will know . maybe they thought it would become a hit or a critical success , and sometimes i don ' t agree with other critics on movies , even from the trailers for this film they made it look bad and showed all the mildly funny parts . its based on the 1925 silent film ' seven chances ' which i am sure is very better than this mess . even though some may think of this as a good date movie , most who see this will want to pull out thier hair and scream for thier money back . besides being a terrible movie , ' the bachelor ' is well a terrible movie . it has nothing worth recommending therefore i really can ' t recommend this movie . i did not have a good time and i laughed only three times . the running time of the movie is 106 minutes which is wayyyy over time and needs to be shortened at least thirty minutes . parts of it seems to go on forever and parts of seem to not last enough time . being one of the worst movies of the year , we can be sure that i hope they will not make anymore stupid unfunny romantic comedies , and if they do they i give up on filmmakers .\",\n",

       " ('since director steven zaillian previously wrote the powerful screenplay for 1993 \\' s steven spielberg drama \" schindler \\' s list \" and directed 1993 \\' s intelligent \" searching for bobby fischer , \" his new film , \" a civil action , \" should most likely be looked upon as an unfortunate misstep in an otherwise prosperous career . what doesn \\' t make sense is how such high - profile and superb actors as john travolta , robert duvall , william h . macy , and kathleen quinlan got involved in this project , which is both dull and completely ineffective . the film , which involves a small community of children who mysteriously died of leukemia , certainly contains the type of story to be emotionally - charged , but somehow all signs of feeling have been completely removed from the proceedings , leaving us with nothing more than a poorly - done courtroom drama . based on a book by jonathan hart , which was consequently based on a true account , \" a civil action \" is set in 1982 in the town of woburn , mass . , where personal injury lawyer jan schlictmann ( john travolta ) decides to take on the case of eight families who simply want an apology for their children \\' s death from leukemia due to unknown causes . jan originally decides to drop the case , but when he stumbles across to corporate giants , grace and beatrice foods , who have plants located near the families \\' homes , he sees all of the pieces suddenly fall into place : the two companies have been leaking harmful chemicals into the nearby lake which , thus , goes into the city \\' s drinking water . suddenly , after hearing about the families \\' heartbreak and personal stories , he begins to care for them and becomes determined to get to the bottom of the mystery , even though he is warned by his staff accountant ( william h . macy ) that no money is coming in to them , only going out . also figuring into the story is jerome facher ( robert duvall ) , beatrice foods \\' corporate counsel , who finds himself in heated waters when jan will not accept his $ 20 - million offer to settle the case . coming from such a talented writer , director , and cast , not to mention one of the most interesting film composers , danny elfman , \" a civil action \" is an astoundingly empty - headed drama , one that includes an intriguing story and somehow transforms it into an admittedly tiresome and occasionally even boring experience . perhaps one of its major problems was that in its attempts to be a relatively uncommercial motion picture , zaillian has misplaced its refreshing unconventional attitude with an absence of magnetism and even meaning . watching the film , i couldn \\' t help but notice its similarities with 1997 \\' s far , far superior film \" the sweet hereafter , \" which dealt with a lawyer , played brilliantly by ian holm , investigating a school bus accident that killed a number of children . in his attempts to find someone who may have been responsible for the accident , holm interviews the grieving parents , as well as the sole surviving passenger , a teenage girl , which starts to remind him of his own teenage daughter , a young drug - addict who has run away from home . not only was the plotting similar to \" a civil action , \" but it also had the same exact running time of 115 minutes . considering this , it is amazing how fulfilling and truthful \" a sweet hereafter \" was , not only concentrating on the school bus accident , but delving deeply into ian holm \\' s character and his own personal demons , as well as the teenage girl . in \" a civil action , \" however , i have no idea where the running time went , since the film is virtually two hours of nothingness . we do not get to know the parents very well , nor any of the main characters . through its whole duration , i did not learn one thing__not one thing__about travolta \\' s lawyer character , jan schlictmann , who doesn \\' t appear to have any sort of life or purpose outside of his job . every scene is tediously related directly to the premise , and therefore , there was no one for me to care about or root for . you \\' ve got to work pretty hard , actually , to not get an audience to become involved in the parents \\' plight , since their children are dead , but that is exactly what \" a civil action \" does . to be honest , i would be fairly hard - pressed to state an aspect of the film that i actually liked . aside from one flashback to when a man \\' s young son died on the way to the doctor , i remained unmoved and passive about what was going on in the scenes , and more than once found my mind wandering . i could say the performances were good , but who \\' s fooling who ? since every character is one - dimensionally written , no one \\' s acting abilities are challenged in any way . travolta plays a lawyer well enough , but that \\' s about all he does . duvall virtually sleepwalks through his role , apparently only appearing to give one - liners at every chance he gets . and what in the world is kathy bates doing in the picture \\' s final scene , as a judge ? she appears unbilled , since it is just a cameo , but why did she even agree to do it in the first place ? finally , when the conclusion arrived and the end credits began to role , the film left me with another question : what was the point ? abruptly ending without any susceptible momentum , where none came before that to begin with , \" a civil action \" seemed to me , at least , to be an example of how not to make a courtroom drama , and it certainly did not do justice to the very serious subject matter the film deals with .',\n",

       " ('what makes reindeer games even more disappointing than just a predictable , lifeless action flick is the cast and crew who signed onto the project . most of the people involved in reindeer games just came off terrible slumps with excellent comeback performances in their most recent films . john frankenheimer , who made the unforgettable cold war drama the manchurian candidate way back in the early 60 \\' s , recently showed critics and fans alike that he still had some magic left in his directorial skills when he created the brilliant car chase scenes in ronin . screenwriter ehren kruger gave a remarkable first impression when he wrote the script for the underrated arlington rd . ben affleck displayed his comedic talents in dogma and boiler room , and even on saturday night live directly after the horrible forces of nature and 200 cigarettes . even charlize theron , who i was convinced couldn \\' t act , did a decent job in cider house rules . when all of these bright stars come together , one would assume that the movie will have great potential to be entertaining . after coming out of the theater showing reindeer games , disbelief was my first reaction ? then frustration . the movie could have premiered on cinemax at two in the morning starring an all - rookie cast and still would have been equally lacking in entertaining . the acting is so pitiful and the script so dull , i may have to rethink some of my opinions on how talented these actors actually are . it seemed like everyone was restricted to just the script and not given a fair amount of improvisational rights . we have all seen ben affleck have some fun on the set , it is so apparent in a number of scenes in good will hunting when he exchanges jokes with his friends at a bar . the actors in that movie were having fun and , from that , the audience had fun . reindeer games is the complete opposite ; the actors don \\' t seem to want to be their characters ( even danny trejo , who will do practically anything , doesn \\' t look like he is enjoying himself ) , causing the audience to quickly lose interest . evidence of public disapproval was noted when a woman behind me yelled \" boy this movie is horrible ! \" and when there were scattered giggles during the most dramatic moments . the story follows a man , rudy ( ben affleck ) , who is leaving prison in a few days along with his best friend and cellmate nick ( james frain ) . nick has been exchanging love letters with a beautiful woman , ashley ( charlize theron ) , and cannot wait to leave prison and meet her in person . when nick is killed in a prison riot , rudy decides to pretend to be nick and take ashley out on a date for the christmas holidays . unfortunately ashley \\' s brother , gabriel ( gary sinise ) interferes with their relationship . thinking rudy is nick , he kidnaps rudy and threatens to kill him unless he helps rob a casino , which nick use to work at as a security guard . now rudy must pretend to be nick so he can protect ashley from her brother gabriel . confused ? the movie only gets more complex as it goes on , until it gets way , way too complex at its climax . but reindeer games makes its first serious mistake during the first half an hour . the hero commits a greedy , selfish act when he decides to pretend he is his dead cellmate in order to date ashley . some hero . the point of a hero is to do the morally correct thing , a person for the audience to relate to or admire . when rudy lies and cheats his way into trouble , instead of gathering support from me for him to ultimately succeed in getting the bad guys , i felt more like he was getting what he deserved and even wanted to see him fail at times . the most irritating part of the film ( besides the fact that this is a christmas movie released in february ) is the number of chances the bad guys get to kill rudy but fail or delay for some idiotic reason . the routine in which the bad guy must explain his genius plan to the hero before attempting to kill him with some elaborate machine is getting so tired nowadays , especially when i eagerly want to see the hero dead . the only saving grace keeping this movie from receiving zero stars is an amusing but pointless cameo from isaac hayes as a prisoner upset with his food . why he was in this movie for such a pointless role beats me . why any of these people had anything at all to do with this movie beats me .',\n",

       " ('historical epic as a genre was almost banished from hollywood in early 1990s . for many critics , scholars and , most importantly , film producers , it was a thing of the past - something that could have attracted crowds only in the era of black - and - white television and non - cgi special effects . but in 1995 , same as in the case of dances with wolves five years ago , there came the man who decided to use of all his energy and talents of actor , producer and director in order to revitalise that particular genre . and , same as in the case of dances with wolves , he was awarded for his effort with \" oscars \" . the name of the film was braveheart , and the name of its director and main actor was mel gibson . the plot chronicles the life of scottish warlord and folk hero william wallace ( 1272 - 1305 ) . in his time , english king edward i \" longshanks \" ( played by patrick mcgoohan ) has almost completely subdued entire british isles , including scotland , whose proud inhabitants are now subjected by \" ius primae noctis \" and various other forms of humiliation and oppression by english knights . although english had killed his father many years ago , young scottish commoner william wallace ( played by mel gibson ) doesn \\' t care about politics and wants only to have peaceful life with his new bride murron ( played by catherine maccormack ) . murron \\' s death changes that and wallace takes arms and , together with small but dedicated band of followers , begins guerrilla campaign that would systematically destroy almost every english garrison in the country . through time , more and more people join his ranks and in 1298 wallace \\' s rag - tag army scores surprising victory against english knights in the battle of stirling bridge . but the newly won freedom is endangered by the internal squabbles between scots themselves , especially nobles under pretender robert the bruce ( played by angus macfadyen ) , who wouldn \\' t like to have a simple commoner as a national leader . braveheart was only the second film in the directorial career by mel gibson , so it wouldn \\' t be fair to compare it to the better known genre classics directed by david lean or anthony mann . however , even when we apply such criteria braveheart is more than decent historical epic that takes new and refreshing approach to the genre . the most noticeable element of this approach is naturalism . while older hollywood films set in medieval europe used to give fairytale - like vision of picturesque castles , splendid costumes and knights in shining armour , gibson shows us the extremely unpleasant world of poverty and feudal injustice where might made right and life was hard , short and brutish . this general unpleasantness is especially underlined in the scenes of battle , where hand - to - hand combat is naturalistically displayed in all its gory details , never seen since verhoeven \\' s ultra - naturalistic flesh & blood . compared with this naturalistic approach , most of old hollywood epics look like stage plays . braveheart also employs humour at the right places , not only to make bloody realities of medieval british isles more bearable to sensitive audiences , but also to underline its down - to - earth atmosphere , so different from previous historical epics . what makes braveheart \" larger than life \" is his protagonist . mel gibson obviously invested plenty of his energy and talent in bringing the mythical figure of william wallace and , as a result , character of 15th century poems is transformed into superhuman being that resembles late 20th century comic book hero . wallace is more than superior to his enemies , both physically and mentally , yet he is able to show his sensitive , more vulnerable side . naturally , when the character is based on epic poems , most of historical accuracy is going down the drain ( which was the case with almost every historical epic from hollywood in 1990s ) . however , even those who don \\' t particularly care about history or are willing to give poetic license to scriptwriter randall wallace might think that he went over the top in idolising wallace , especially in the second part of film when scottish superhero manages to seduce princess isabel ( played by sophie marceau ) and make her a child . because of that the disbelief is hardly suspended , and final scenes aren \\' t as effective as they should be . mel gibson as an actor is truly wonderful , and he is also helped by small army of very good british and irish actors . most memorable of them all is patrick mcgoohan , whose cold , calculated and evil medieval monarch is one of the most effective villains seen in contemporary cinema . brendan gleeson ( who would later become famous for his role in boorman \\' s general ) is also very good as wallace \\' s trusted companion , as well as ian bannen is effective as leprosy - stricken king john balliol . david o \\' harra is very entertaining as wallace \\' s irish ally , and angus macfadyen brings a lot of anxiety into his conscience - stricken character of robert the bruce . women in this film have rather thankless roles , especially marceau as one - dimensional french princess . catherine mccormack as wallace \\' s wife was more interesting , but she was eliminated from the picture early on . from the technical point of view , the film is also very good . photography by john toll brings a lot of scottish natural beauty to the screen . on the other hand , the musical score by james horner employs too much of modern - day instruments for period piece set in medieval times . although mostly welcomed by critics and audiences alike , braveheart was often criticised for homophobia and other forms of extreme conservatism . the main reason for that was the fact that gibson , among many historical facts , chose to be faithful only to those related to sexual orientation of \" longshank \" \\' s son prince edward ( played by peter hanly ) . he is not only presented as a villain , but also as one of the less competent in villain \\' s camp - and portraying of homosexuals as villains or inferior to heterosexuals is almost unforgivable sin in \" politically correct \" hollywood . to make things even more obvious , good guys in this film are the total opposite of effeminate and incompetent edward - rugged macho men of mountains who are more practical and efficient because they tend to employ conservatives \\' common sense instead of fashionable theories of ivory tower liberals . however , although the message of this film might look right - wing , it owes more to leftist ideology of various national liberation movements in 20th century . according to that ideology , oppressed classes ( workers , peasants ) are better suited to fight for national freedom because their members has less to lose in that struggle and , as such , they are more radical , less willing to make compromises and more efficient ; on the other hand , privileged classes ( aristocracy , bourgeoisie ) are more likely to betray the cause of freedom and be in cahoots with foreign oppressors in order to keep their privileges . this marxist worldview is presented in braveheart without any subtlety . in the end , whether the audience is patient enough to discover hidden meanings or simply wants to enjoy entertaining historical epic , braveheart is more than adequate choice for all fans of this recently resurrected genre .',\n",

       " (\"i wonder if budget is at all a criterion for whether or not a movie can be considered an exploitation flick . take the professional , for example . it boasts extremely glossy cinematography , a couple of recognizable name actors , and a couple of fairly impressive explosions . it ' s also basically about violence and cheap titilation , and features a central relationship between a middle - aged man and a twelve - year - old girl with a decidedly ambiguous sexual dimension . the professional is all over the map , and its pretensions of being about anything more than its most unpleasant elements simply make it all the more unpleasant . the professional of the title is a new york hit man named leon ( jean reno ) , brutally efficient but also very isolated . one day he is forced to let someone into his life when a girl from his apartment building knocks on his door . her name is matilda ( natalie portman ) , and the rest of her family has just been killed by crooked and very wired d . e . a . agent norman stansfield ( gary oldman ) after matilda ' s father tried to rip him off . leon reluctantly takes matilda in , then begins to teach her his profession when she says that she wants to avenge the murder of her young brother . the two become closer , which makes them all the more vulnerable when stansfield learns that they know too much , and sets out to eliminate them both . writer / director luc besson has gone this route before with his popular french import la femme nikita , a slick potboiler about a female assassin . there is no question that besson can make a great * looking * film ; with the assistance of cinematographer thierry arbogast , he has created a film chock full of moody close - ups and evocative lighting . but beneath the shiny wrapper , there isn ' t nearly as much going on as besson would like us to believe . the relationship between leon and matilda never clicks because neither one is given a character to develop . leon is mostly a collection of quirky traits , all intended to show us that for a hired killer , he ' s really not so bad a guy : he drinks lots of milk , takes meticulous care of a potted plant , and enjoys gene kelly movies . jean reno succeeds at giving leon a haunted and desperate quality , but he never makes an emotional connection to matilda . natalie portman is all wrong for a part that called for a much grittier quality , but she doesn ' t have too much to work with , either . besson would have been better served spending more time trying to bring his characters to life , and less on feeble attempts at humor which are often embarrassing . a silly game between leon and matilda involving celebrity impersonations is completely out of place , as is a scene where matilda shocks a hotel manager by announcing that leon is her lover ; character is thoroughly sacrificed for a cheap gag . gary oldman ' s entire part is something of a cheap gag , wild - eyed and way over the top , but at least he is interesting to watch . there isn ' t a real person to be found anywhere in the professional , which isn ' t always a problem in an action thriller , except that this one is trying to pass itself off as something more . a more disconcerting problem with the professional is that it plays around with the sexuality of a twelve - year - old in a really distasteful way . there were only two real choices for dealing with that component of leon and matilda ' s relationship : confront it head on , or ignore it entirely . but besson flirts and teases the audience with the idea that he ' s going to show them a forbidden love story , while choosing simply to focus his camera on portman ' s rear end and dress her in skimpy clothing . this is to say nothing of the questionable decision to make it look like quality paternal time when leon is teaching a child to load a 9mm pistol , or the blood which is spilled aplenty . a great deal of the time , the professional is just plain sleazy , and all the soft filters in the world can ' t disguise that fact .\",\n",

( of course , this concept dates to the 1974 hammer films - run run shaw production of legend of the seven golden vampires , in which dracula is defeated by seven karate - chopping siblings . ) wesley snipes is buff as blade . he growls his lines - the few he has - and spends most of the time glowering - as if he was suffering from indigestion or having second thoughts about starring in and co - producing this turkey . blade is just another example of how the vampire film , a once honorable member of the horror family , has gone downhill . this dud mostly makes you yearn for those quaint old days when christopher lee could be stopped just by dangling a crucifix in his face . today ' s vampires lack the panache , the style of a bela lugosi or a christopher lee . they are not even worthy enough to carry those great bloodsuckers ' capes . they are more farcical than frightful . this whole enterprise is one dull blade that could have used lots of sharpening .\",\n",

well , the commercial part is . as for the movie , well , as long as i can watch tom hanks and meg ryan , i think i \\' ll be okay . to paraphrase james berardinelli , whose reviews i admire very much , tom hanks and meg ryan can act . they are both wonderful , but for all of hanks \\' glorious work in serious films , such as his magnificent performance in saving private ryan , and his glorious triumph in philadelphia , i like him best when he \\' s suitably obnoxious . tom hanks is wonderful when he is obnoxious in a romantic comedy when he \\' s going to get the girl : the only question is how ? meg ryan , america \\' s high school sweetheart , can act . she \\' s had a handful of memorable performances , including the great scene in the diner in when harry met sally ( i must not mention what she does , due to the , well , um , you get the idea , and if you don \\' t , get the movie -- fantastic ) . but , i like her best when she \\' s , well , perky . she is so adorably perky / cute that together with hanks , they are the most amazing onscreen duo in my short lifetime . some people have them going back to really old classic romantic couples , but i don \\' t really know . all i know is that i just like them both . they have such wonderfully kinetic chemistry that \\' s really hard to resist , and i \\' m not going to even try . they \\' re just really , really cute , sweet , and charming . hanks and ryan collaborate once again with nora ephron , who directed them in the megahit sleepless in seattle . here , the setup is a little different . kathleen kelly ( ryan ) owns a small children \\' s bookstore which her mother founded 42 years ago and passed down to her . she is successful , beautiful , and dates a well - known columnist with very radical idea ( kinnear ) . she is also having an affair , of sorts . you see , kathleen , with the handle shopgirl , is secretly emailing ny152 . they have a strictly un - detailed relationship : there are no specifics , and they have no idea who each other is . ny152 happens to be joe fox ( hanks ) , a multimillionaire bookseller who is the heir to the fortune of the fox chain of mega - bookstores , run by his father ( coleman ) . fox books has decided to open a store on the west side , right across from a little children \\' s bookseller named \" shop around the corner \" , run by a perky girl named kathleen kelly . every morning , these two email each other silly , and every day , they fight \" to the death ! ! \" . it \\' s a charming premise , and one that works nicely , balancing the immense troubles kathleen is in with the romance she wants to have . it also has the great sense of being a classic romance : there is no \" let \\' s have sex tonight \" mantra , if you \\' ll excuse my bluntness . this is a solid romance built around that vague concept of love . hmm . well , the movie goes through twists and turns , having some sad moments and happy ones , until at one moment tom hanks and meg ryan \" hook up \" , to use modern terminology , and kiss their way into happiness . you know it \\' s going to happen , the question is now ? thankfully , ephron has a wonderful supporting cast with posey , kinnear , chappelle , and a host of others , including a great scene involving brothers , aunts , and two sweet kids . it \\' s all cute and wonderful , and for all of the idealism , it makes me feel good . hanks is as obnoxious as ever on the outside and as warm on the inside as he always is . he is , i believe , america \\' s greatest actor . does he show it here ? nah . but he \\' s still tom hanks , and she \\' s still meg ryan . which is what this movie boils down to . it \\' s pure confection . all the bits about the godfather , the jokes , the superb script , it \\' s all really sweet . there are some immense flaws , like pacing . the last third of the movie really doesn \\' t work as well as i would have liked , and for a romantic comedy , it \\' s slow . once hanks knows the secret , it gets really slow . i even looked at my watch a couple times , to make sure ephron was going to deliver the big onscreen kiss i was waiting for , so that i could get home at a reasonable hour . the other problem is that this movie is shaping up to be really dated . e - mail ? when my kids are my age , i don \\' t know what we \\' ll be using . but hanks can do more with one eyeroll than anybody , and meg ryan just loves to dive into a pillow better than anyone in movie history . they just work together , and it \\' s nice to see . it gives you , well , a smile . the script helps with some great lines that are absolutely hilarious , and that always come at the exact right time to keep the audience awake . i was arguing with my father on the drive back home on what the purpose of movies was . i \\' ve always believed that movies are very powerful , very powerful indeed . you see , mankind has three abilities he needs to survive : the ability to think , entertain , and procreate . movies can definitely do the first two , and as for the third , well , i \\' d rather not think about that . i always thought films that made you think enlightened you and made you see something from another viewpoint , and that films that entertained you were good , because you forgot about your troubles and thought about something nice for a night . and i was thinking about how incredible a year tom hanks has had . hanks was the driving force behind one of the year \\' s best films in saving private ryan , which is one of those thinking films that truly made someone wonder about the world . he \\' s also half of the glue behind the year \\' s best example of pure entertainment . tom hanks and meg ryan are magical , as is this movie . it \\' s a sweet , lovely affair with a technology twist . it may be a long commercial , but it gave me a pretty big smile on my face .',\n",

       " ('only a year after the initial release of \" scream , \" the horror send - up from veteran horror director wes craven and screenwriter kevin williamson that seemed to breathe new life into the slasher genre , the inevitable sequel \" scream 2 \" has arrived in our theaters . while the tongue - in - cheek , parodic element is still noticeable in this film , it \\' s really a sideshow to a broader commentary on violence and the media and a more conventional horror story . the first film , while often violent and gruesome , was mostly lacking in genuine scares because almost every scene was played for camp value and the discussion of the quirks and cliches of horror movies was nearly constant . the premise of \" scream 2 \" is that a series of copycat killings begin when a movie called \" stab , \" based on a book written by opportunistic reporter gail weathers ( courtney cox ) about the events in \" scream , \" is released and two audience members are killed during the opening screening . i had heard about this scene before i went to see the film and was surprised to find this sequence largely lacking in camp comedy . its conclusion , in which a bleeding , wounded woman stumbles in front of the screen and dies in front of an audience that cheers on because they think it \\' s a publicity stunt , is more surreal and disturbing than anything else . the satire in \" scream 2 \" thus takes on a broad focus and gradually evolves into an exploration of media perceptions in general . although resident horror film geek randy ( jamie kennedy ) is back with fresh dialogue about sequels ( and , interestingly enough , how they are usually inferior to their predecessors ) , the characters in this movie are drawing from other entries in the pop culture encyclopedia as well . everything from \" friends \" and \" saved by the bell \" to \" showgirls \" and \" terminator 2 \" is referenced here ; horror is only one of many genres available for lampooning , and there aren \\' t any \" wes carpenter \" jokes this time . more importantly , this film portrays characters willing to go to disturbing lengths for media attention as well as characters whose perceptions have clearly been warped by what they have seen on tv and film . the killings are clearly an imitation of the previous murders from \" scream \" ( in fact , the culprit even plans to use the influence of horror movies as a courtroom defense ) , weathers exploits the situation for her own notoriety , and one man seems willing to save the heroine \\' s life only if it will earn him an interview on the today show . understandably , \" scream 2 \" does not go so far as to actually blame the movies , but rather shows that those who do imitate horror movies are already sick and twisted . couple that with the fact that several of the characters , most notably the lead character sidney prescott ( neve campbell ) , are fairly well - developed and that there are some genuine moments of spine - chilling suspense , and what we have is a pretty darned good horror movie in its own right . we don \\' t just get the horror of scary masks and graphic gore - we also get the horror of sympathetic characters who seem helpless as their friends are slaughtered ( and , in one case , a significant character who was an audience favorite even bites the dust ) and whose lives have been reduced to constant fear of a crazed murderer lurking around the corner . while i have not seen any of his other work , it \\' s easy to see why craven is generally touted as the most sophisticated \" slasher film \" director , as he clearly cares about something more than just the actual acts of slashing . unfortunately , \" scream 2 \" occasionally reverts to the time - honored horror tradition of throwing logic out the window . for example , several characters seem quite clearly dead and inexplicably turn up alive later - there has been a running gag in both movies about the villain being able to pull off this particular trick , but it also happens with other characters and in an even less believable fashion . there are also a few scenes in which the killer suddenly appears behind the next victim in a situation such that ( s ) he clearly would have been seen moving in that direction . as for the question of whether or not \" scream 2 \" is yet another sequel not as good as its predecessor . . . well , it \\' s hard to say . i gave the first \" scream \" 3 1 / 2 stars as well because it worked pretty consistently as a light - hearted send - up . \" scream 2 \" bounces all over the place stylistically , but it does a better job delivering the genuine scares and asking the questions about media violence that were only hinted at in the first installment . i \\' m not sure which is the better movie , but i did leave the theater convinced of one thing : sequels , however much randy might argue , do not necessarily suck .',\n",

n , eva , who slept her way to the top and became famous chiefly because she got attention , much like the woman playing her : madonna ( although i think madonna did rise to the top for her musical talent , among other things ) . \" evita \" deals with the rise and fall of eva per ? n , a woman who captured the heart of the nation after marrying juan ( jonathan pryce ) , then died at the young age of 33 , creating an international stir of mourning not unlike that of princess di ( the two do share a bit in common , although it wasn \\' t like di slept to \" the top \" ) . webber and rice sure chose bizarre topics for their musicals , but they always have a point for doing it . here , they wish to expose her for what she is , but still show that despite all of her many drawbacks , her lying , and covering up for her fascist husband , but show that she was still a good woman with fairly good intentions , and her death was very sad . it \\' s also a musical , with almost no words not unsung . the film plays like a rock opera , much like their \" jesus christ superstar , \" with many giant musical sequences just like the old musicals , even if they do possess very intelligent lyrics , which create not only an intellectually enlightening experience , but also a very entertaining one . after all , this is a musical , and webber \\' s musicals never undermine this . they are a balance of energy and intellectual depth , walking on a fine line between the both , and never stumbling on either side . this is why the beginning of \" evita \" is kind of a let - down . okay , it is a let - down . i \\' m not saying the opening moments are bad , because they \\' re pretty good . but what comes after is a lifeless , un - entertaining , and totally unrewarding sequence where she cons a singer ( jimmy nail ) into taking eva to buenos aires after a one - night stand . in the musical , it \\' s a fun , energetic sequence , culiminating in the show stopper , \" buenos aires , \" which is also lifeless . then a punch is pulled as we see eva being screwed over by the singer , instead of her leaving him , where she ends up singing the sad tune , \" another suitcase in another hall , \" which was meant for a later character , screwed over by eva . the portrayal of eva in the beginning is too soft , seeming like parker and oliver stone , who adapted it for the screen , are afraid to present her for what she is , even while it \\' s being narrated by a hater of eva \\' s , the omnipotent ( antonio banderas ) , who presents her in a negative light . for a while , it looks like alan parker can \\' t pull it off . however , the film pulls itself together in a flash , and after that song is over , and the giddily nihilistic song \" goodbye and thank you , \" where we see eva go through a long line of lovers who help her ascend , is magnificent , darkly comical , and just gleeful . from this point on , the film is hypnotic , satisfying , and satirical . no more punches are thrown , and the basic outline of the original musical are in tact . we see eva woo and marry juan , get him out of jail , rise to stardom , falter a bit , come back , and then gradually die of cancer ( i think it was because of cancer ) . more importantly , many of the themes from the musical carry on with this , as well as some filling - in - the - gaps reconnassaince work . juan , who is pretty underwritten in the musical , is given some extra scenes , and exposed as what he was for eva : an accessory . a muted scene where he tries to visit her respective room but is shunned allows us to learn more about juan , and understand his sadness more than we did before . > from the \" goodbye and thank you \" number on , the film shows eva trying to cover up for the horrible government by doing cheap and petty things which wooed a nation , and saved a government , even while it left the nation \\' s people downtrodden . but despite this , the nation still loved eva , and when she slipped into death , the world mourned her because she was a star . that \\' s when our narrator , ch ? , comes out to show that she wasn \\' t the great woman she really was , and expose her fame . describing this character is difficult , mainly because he has no real realistic background ( he \\' s said to be based on the revolutionary ch ? guevera , but the two probably could have never met , like they do in the film ) , but he serves as a perspective on eva , but even his perspective can \\' t help us from feeling bad when eva dies a pathetic death . alan parker , no stranger to bizarre musicals ( he \\' s done \" fame , \" \" the committments , \" \" bugsy malone , \" and \" pink floyd the wall \" - the latter which is absolutely brilliant ) , nails the film , exposing everything for what it is . we cry for evita at the end because we feel we should , by the way it is presented . his direction is manipulative for a reason : to show the mourning for what it is . and there is energy throughout , with lots of bright colors , and scenes which are cinematically entertaning , as well as enriching and deep , such as the balcony scene where she sings \" don \\' t cry for me , argentina , \" and her death sequence , which is poignant becuase of how sad it is . madonna \\' s golden globe winning performance is much like the movie : starts kinda downhill then goes up quickly , remaning there for the rest of the film . at the beginning , she looks like she \\' s too busy concentrating on her singing to act , but she eventually gets it right , though never really getting the presence of , say , patti lupone ( who did the role in its american premiere back in the late 70s ) . her death , though , is brilliant . her singing could be better though . i know she took lessons to improve her range and all , but it still sounds like she \\' s trying to hard . she sounds way too soft in several places where she should be comanding ( like . . . patti lupone - i heard her sing on an old \" evita \" cd , and you could just feel her stage presence without even seeing her ) . but it \\' s generally very good , although not up to the brilliance the role really requires . antonio banderas , who is almost like a guilty pleasure these days ( i \\' m one of the few people who thinks he rocks ) , is extremely comanding in his performance , presenting a lovable narrator . his singing is very good , though nothing compared to the original , mandy patinkin . he does have a pretty good singing voice , and a great range . and jonathan pryce is pretty awesome , although very brief at times , in his role as juan , seeming to put on a poker face for his melancholy facade . although it gets off to a rocky start ( \" rocky \" \\' s polite for what it really is ) , it soon picks up and becomes a wonderully poignant musical . like the other musical released in \\' 96 ( woody allen \\' s \" everyone says i love you \" ) , it \\' s a reminder that the hollywood musical may be dead , but it can come back every now and then for a brief performance .',\n",

       " ('note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . be forewarned . during the three years since the release of the groundbreaking success pulp fiction , the cinematic output from its creator , quentin tarantino , has been surprisingly low . oh , he \\' s been busy -- doing the talk show circuit , taking small roles in various films , overseeing the production of his screenplay from dusk till dawn , making cameo appearances on television shows , providing a vignette for the ill - fated anthology four rooms -- everything , it seems , except direct another feature - length film . it \\' s been the long intermission between projects as well as the dizzying peak which pulp fiction reached which has made mr . tarantino \\' s new feature film , jackie brown , one of the most anticipated films of the year , and his third feature film cements his reputation as the single most important new american filmmaker to emerge from the 1990s . things aren \\' t going well for jackie brown ( pam grier ) . she \\' s 44 years old , stuck at a dead - end job ( \" $ 16 , 000 a year , plus retirement benefits that aren \\' t worth a damn \" ) as a flight attendant for the worst airline in north america -- and she \\' s just been caught at the airport by atf agent ray nicolette ( portrayed with terrific childlike enthusiasm by michael keaton ) and police officer mark dargus ( michael bowen ) smuggling $ 50 000 from mexico for gun - runner ordell robbie ( samuel l . jackson ) , who has her bailed out by unassuming bail bondsman max cherry ( robert forster ) . the loquacious ordell , based out of a hermosa beach house where his horny , bong - hitting surfer girl melanie ( bridget fonda ) and agreeable crony louis gara ( robert de niro ) hang out , operates under the policy that the best rat is a dead rat , and he \\' s soon out to silence jackie brown . meanwhile , the authorities \\' target is ordell , and they want jackie to help them by arranging a sting to the tune of a half - million dollars . only through a series of clever twists , turns , and double - crosses will jackie be able to gain the upper hand on both of her nemeses . although jackie brown marks mr . tarantino \\' s first produced screenplay adaptation ( based on the elmore leonard novel \" rum punch \" ) , there \\' s no mistaking his distinctive fingerprints all over this film . while he \\' s adhered closely to the source material in a narrative sense , the setting has been relocated to los angeles and the lead character \\' s now black . in terms of ambiance , the film harkens back to the 1970s , from the wall - to - wall funk and soul music drowning the soundtrack to the nondescript look of the sets -- even the opening title credit sequence has the echo of vintage 1970s productions . the opening sequence featuring ms . grier wordlessly striding through the lax , funky music blaring away on the speakers , is emblematic of films of that era . the timeframe for the film is in fact 1995 , but the atmosphere of jackie brown is decidedly retro . of course , nothing in the film screams 1970s more than the casting of pam grier and robert forster as the two leads , and although the caper intrigue is fun to watch as the plot twists , backstabbing , and deceptions deliciously unfold , the strength of jackie brown is the quiet , understated relationship developed between jackie and max ; when they kiss , it \\' s perhaps the most tender scene of the year . tenderness ? in a quentin tarantino film ? sure , there \\' ve been moments of sweetness in his prior films -- the affectionate exchanges between the bruce willis and maria de madeiros characters in pulp fiction and the unflagging dedication shared by the characters of tim roth and amanda plummer , or even in reservoir dogs , where a deep , unspoken bond develops between the harvey keitel and tim roth characters -- but for the most part , mr . tarantino \\' s films are typified by manic energy , unexpected outbursts of violence , and clever , often wordy , banter . these staples of his work are all present in jackie brown , but what \\' s new here is a different facet of his storytelling -- a willingness to imbue the film with a poignant emotional undercurrent , and a patience to draw out several scenes with great deliberation . this effective demonstration of range prohibits the pigeonholing of mr . tarantino as simply a helmer of slick , hip crime dramas with fast - talking lowlifes , and heralds him as a bonafide multifaceted talent ; he \\' s the real deal . this new aspect of mr . tarantino \\' s storytelling is probably best embodied in a single character -- that of the world - weary , sensitive , and exceedingly - professional max cherry , whose unspoken attraction to jackie is touching . mr . forster \\' s nuanced , understated performance is the best in the film ; he creates an amiable character of such poignancy that when he gazes at jackie , we smile along with him . much press has been given about the casting of blaxploitation - era icon pam grier in the lead , with the wags buzzing that mr . tarantino may do for her what his pulp fiction did to bolster john travolta \\' s then - sagging career . as it turns out , ms . grier is solid in the film \\' s title role , although nothing here forces her to test her range . i do have to take exception to the claim that this film marks her career resurrection , though -- she \\' s been working steadily over the years , often in direct - to - video action flicks , but also in such recent theatrical releases as tim burton \\' s mars attacks ! and larry cohen \\' s original gangstas ( where she first teamed up with mr . forster . ) of course , it \\' s true that her role here was a godsend -- a meaty a part as this is rarity for * any * actress , let alone one of her age and current status in the industry . while jackie brown may disappoint those looking for another pulp fiction clone , it marks tremendous growth of mr . tarantino as a director whose horizons are rapidly expanding , and whose characterizations have never been better . and while the film \\' s narrative doesn \\' t really warrant a running time of 155 minutes , it \\' s filled with such sumptuous riches , ranging from the brashness of the vivid soundtrack to entertaining , inconsequential conversations between the characters , that there wasn \\' t an unengaging moment . with an impressive trio of feature films under his belt , it \\' ll be interesting to see what he tries next .',\n",

) . as if that weren \\' t enough , ellie \\' s discovery leads her to the nation \\' s capital where she again runs into palmer . contact is based on the novel by carl sagan and deals heavily with the subject of science vs . religion . the impressive thing is how well both aspects are presented , with no signs of bias . arguments for both sides are intelligent , solid , and thought - provoking . when palmer joins a selection committee to choose an ambassador to vega ( of which ellie is a leading candidate ) , personal convictions play a more important role than love interests . the question is , can a person who doesn \\' t believe in god truly be the best representative of earth when 90 % of the planet * does * believe in a higher power ? even when the film wraps up , it \\' s uncertain whether it \\' s meant to play as an advocate for religion , science , both , or even neither , and in our modern day society where \" right and wrong \" is only opinion ( at least speaking \" politically correctly \" ) , the ambiguity is an incentive . don \\' t get me wrong . as much as it sounds like it , contact isn \\' t merely a theology class rolled into a reel of film . it \\' s a * highly * enjoyable two and a half hours . despite its seemingly heavy issues , it \\' s not a tedious undertaking to watch this film . the special effects are outstanding , though ( warning ! ) highly depreciated on the small screen . even so , some of the subtle visual effects ( that will likely go unnoticed by many ) are even more impressive than ones more recognizable as \" sci - fi \" . the storytelling is rich and complete , and although there are moments in the film that feel quite pretentious ( and at times , even hokey ) , it \\' s easily one of the best 1997 films , and one of the best sci - fi films i \\' ve ever seen . this is zemeckis \\' best since back to the future , and for those of us who actually know that forrest gump was astronomically overrated , zemeckis now has real reason to boast .',\n",

       " ('eyes wide shut isn \\' t the masterpiece many were hoping to see in stanley kubrick \\' s final film , but it is an impressive achievement ; a mesmerizing , haunting , adult psychodrama about marriage , fidelity and sex . it \\' s a stanley kubrick film from beginning to end , consistently exhibiting the auteur \\' s trademark penchant for long , continuous takes , his unparalleled deftness behind the camera and his uncanny ability to extract gorgeous performances from his exhausted cast ( indeed , eyes wide shut attained infamy even before its release for its notoriously laborious shoot : kubrick , a renowned perfectionist , reportedly held his cast \" hostage \" on the set for nearly a year ) . in an uncharacteristic maneuver , kubrick cast two big - name stars in the lead roles , namely real - life husband and wife tom cruise and nicole kidman . they play bill and alice harford , a volatile couple who , during the course of a couple nights , ponder the validity of the idea that a husband and a wife must be faithful to each other . he is an m . d . , she \\' s unemployed and we are introduced to them as they are getting ready to go to a fancy party . at the affair , they are both propositioned and both nearly succumb to the temptation to play around with someone else . when they return to their lavish new york apartment kidman ( after smoking a dash of weed ) inquires whether her husband had sex with two models who approached him during the night . he ( truthfully ) says that he did not and asks what happened with that hungarian guy she was dancing with . they proceed to argue until alice tells her spouse a lustful story : evidently some time ago , she had a thing for a young naval officer . she admits that she was ready to give up her whole future with bill and their young daughter if this guy wanted her even for one night . bill is jolted by alice \\' s story and we anticipate his reaction , but at that moment he gets a phone call and has to go \" show his face \" at the house of a just - deceased patient . this turns out to be the beginning of a long and eventful night on the town . the daughter of the dead patient hits on him but he wisely turns her down . he almost does the dirty deed with a kindly hooker who approaches him on the street . then , through a series of coincidences , he winds up at a gothic mansion where a ritualistic ( and frankly , creepy ) orgy takes place , with costumed people performing various public sex acts on each other . erotic dread mounts as cruise ( who \\' s not supposed to be there ) wonders the spacious halls watching the \" action \" until he is discovered to be an outsider . much hoopla has been raised over the fact that warner bros . digitally edited the orgy scene . with the help of a computer , they put in cloaked figures to block some of the actual sex acts ( they can still be seen , just not in all their glory ) in order to avoid the dreaded nc - 17 rating . european viewers will see the film as kubrick envisioned it . roger ebert calls the american version the \" austin powers version , \" and many others have bashed the alterations . i am of the potentially controversial opinion that the figures only supplement the scene \\' s mystical atmosphere . the first thing one notices about eyes wide shut is how it looks . this is an artful , distinctively gorgeous production , shot in dark , moody hues and featuring some elaborate , beautiful scenery . from the giant mansion used in the film \\' s centerpiece to the decor at the christmas party to the harford \\' s apartment , this film is always a pleasure to look at . to boot , a great soundtrack makes it more atmospheric still . at the core , behind the graphic , controversial content and unappealing mood , this is a good - natured movie that emphasizes the importance of fidelity . it looks at sex as almost perfunctory by portraying it as unnerving rather than erotic . it \\' s something superficial and yet something necessary to achieve a deeper relationship . at the end , it seems , bill \\' s eyes are wide open to the special kind of love he and his wife have for each other , more meaningful than anything he could ever hope to find on the streets of new york . kubrick elicits wonderful performances from both cruise and kidman . tom is completely convincing as dr . harford , a man who seems guided solely by destiny , with no control of the course his life will take . nicole projects a quiet intensity as the jittery yet aggressive wife and her performance is stunningly effective : she \\' s headed for an oscar nod . the movie has some help from a similarly strong supporting cast , at the head of which is director - cum - thespian sidney pollock , enigmatic and articulate as harford \\' s mysterious friend . eyes wide shut is not perfect : the last hour could have used a slightly more scissor - happy editor and both cruise and kidman are too good -

       " (\"and now the high - flying hong kong style of filmmaking has made its way down to the classics , and it isn ' t pretty . this time out the nod to asia goes by way of france in the excruciating bland and lukewarm production of the musketeer , a version of dumas ' s the three musketeers . by bringing in popular asian actor / stunt coordinator xing xing xiong -- whose only prior american attempts at stunt choreography have been the laughable van damme vehicle double team and the dennis rodman cinematic joke simon sez -- our musketeers are thrown into the air to do their fighting . the end result is a tepid and dull action / adventure rip - off that stinks of indiana jones and bad asian kung fu . the story is so simple my grandmother could have adapted the screenplay . d ' artagnan ( justin chambers ) is the vengeful son of a slain musketeer . he travels to paris to join the royal musketeers and find the man that killed his parents . in paris , he meets the cunning cardinal richelieu ( stephen rea ) , who is trying to overthrow the king , and richelieu ' s man - in - black associate febre ( tim roth ) , the killer of his folks . he finds the musketeers in paris disbanded and drunk , so he rounds up aramis ( nick moran ) , athos ( jan gregor kremp ) and porthos ( steven spiers ) to free the musketeer ' s wrongfully imprisoned leader treville from the king ' s prison . d ' artagnan and his new frisky love interest / chambermaid francesca ( mena suvari ) play footsy and coo at each other as the cardinal hunts down the musketeers until finally the queen ( catherine deneuve ) ends up being captured by the menancing febre , forcing the musketeers to regroup , with d ' artagnan leading the charge , and save the day . director peter hyams ( end of days ) obviously wanted to blend eastern and western filmmaking styles , but here it ' s a disaster . one problem is that , in reality , most eastern films have taken their lead from western ones . jet li ' s high risk is a rip - off of die hard -- not the other way around . ironically , there is awfully little swordplay or action in the film at all -- maybe ten minutes of swashbuckling spread over five scenes . most asian action films carry the bulk of their production with 20 - to 30 - minute action sequences , because they know the scenes have to carry the picture . the musketeer instead weighs itself down with a predictable and monotonous screenplay by gene quintano ( sudden death ) , horrible acting by stephen rea and tim roth , and the prosaic attempt of justin chambers ( the wedding planner ) to deliver his mousy self as a leader . chambers ' d ' artangnan isn ' t a musketeer -- he ' s a mouseketeer ! and hyam ' s use of candles and torches to light the grime and filth of 17th century paris are well - noted , but that ' s the only standout in an overall flat production .\",\n",

       " ('capsule : a short punchy action sequel to the two dinosaur films made by steven spielberg . joe johnston directs a straightforward story of an excursion back to the island of the dinosaurs . it lets us see some new dinosaurs ( is that an oxymoron ? ) and gives us a nice and generally reasonably written adventure . the film is neither ambitious nor pretentious . i had a good time . , low + 2 ( - 4 to + 4 ) here goes my credibility . this is a film on which i expect to be in a minority . i liked the third jurassic park film . i even liked the second jurassic park film . in a lot of ways jurassic park : the lost world was a creative three - way braiding together of michael crichton \\' s novel the lost world , arthur conan doyle \\' s novel the lost world , and the classic silent film version of the doyle . jp2 was an adventure , as doyle said , \" for the boy who \\' s half man or the man who \\' s half boy . \" that is what all the jurassic park films are . expecting them to give the viewer insights into the human condition is like expecting your car to vacuum your house . the classic adventure films like gunga din or king solomon \\' s mines had under - written characters also . jurassic park iii is an all out adventure on an island inhabited by dinosaurs . the characters are a little more complex than they at first appear to be , and even that is a little more complex than i was expecting . some of the characters who start out looking stupid and useless prove to be neither as the film proceeds . that degree of complexity combined with those very realistic looking dinosaur effects is just about as much as i require . i feel i got my money \\' s worth . the story opens with eric ( played by trevor morgan ) and friend parasailing near the forbidden island of isla sorna off costa rica . this was the research island where the dinosaurs were created for the now defunct jurassic park . they hope , no doubt , to get a look at the island \\' s dinosaurs from a safe height . the height is safe , but driving the boat in the water is not . the two soon find themselves in trouble and have to ditch their parasail onto the island where they do indeed get a better look at the dinosaurs than they had intended . flash to the united states and someone is offering to fund paleontologist alan grant ( sam neill ) in his research if he will go and fly over isla sorna and act as a guide . he has said that no force on earth or heaven could get him back near real dinosaurs . but again money convinces him to drop what he is doing and go . doing the convincing is a wealthy and eccentric couple ( william h . macy and tea leoni ) who has been just about everywhere else in the world and wants the adventure of seeing real dinosaurs . they too plan to see the island from a safe height grant is relieved to learn . he will fly over this island at a safe altitude just this once . right . guess what happens next ? jp3 probably functions better as a sequel than jp2 . first it has alan grant and ellie sattler ( laura dern ) back rather than the much less appealing ian malcolm . sattler has a much smaller part in jp3 , but is still present to tie this story to the first . curiously each film seems to arrange to have a signature scene with characters holding on to some large metal object that is about to fall some great distance . one thing that does not quite fit with the earlier films is just as grant discovers that raptors may be able to talk to each other , suddenly they seem to be doing it all the time . they did not appear to be conversing in the previous films . of course , these raptors look a little different also , so perhaps they are a different related species . not only are they more intelligent than in the past films , they are also more sympathetic . in this story they are not just killing machines , they have reasonable motives for what they do beyond nutrition . this time around they may be a little too anthropomorphized . each new film in the series introduces us to some new dinosaurs , of course . in this film a major threat is from a spinosaurus , not as common or as popularly known as a tyrannosaurus , but larger and presumably more nasty . it has a crocodile \\' s head and the body that looks like a dimetrodon walking upright . perhaps as an economy measure or just to create a mood the visual effects team frequently obscures our view of the dinosaurs . sometimes they just move too fast to see . occasionally darkness or fog obscures our vision . a few times we get unconvincing matte shot , particularly of the laboratory . but there is less money on the screen in terms of dinosaur effects than in the two previous films . the musical score by don davis borrows heavily from john williams \\' s score for the first film . joe johnston , who directs , already has to his credit two very good films i recommend the rocketeer and october sky . a team including alexander payne and jim taylor known for election writes the screenplay . the film they have made is a long way from great cinema , but it still is fun . if you get a thrill from seeing what look very much like live dinosaurs alive today , the film is for you . i rate it a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low + 2 on the - 4 to + 4 scale .',\n",

. the soft - core sex sequences are generic , and don \\' t generate much heat . the lesbian kisses can \\' t hold a candle to those in bound . theresa russell and denise richards have only token topless appearances ( neve campbell , possessing an iron - clad \" no nudity \" clause in her contract , keeps her clothes more or less on ) . the film \\' s greatest curiosity is a full frontal shot of kevin bacon climbing out of the shower . maybe a few girls will skip seeing a fully - clothed leonardo dicaprio for the thirteenth time in titanic to catch a glimpse of what kyra sedgwick ( mrs . kevin bacon ) is familiar with . the director of wild things is john mcnaughton , whose last effort was the finely - tuned psychological thriller , normal life . that movie featured copious sex , a pair of real characters , and a powerful script . it \\' s difficult to believe that something this shallow could come from the same film maker . but i suppose we all need to put food on the table . mcnaughton appears to have completely lost his way here , in what is obviously a stab at mainstream success ( his previous wide - release picture , mad dog and glory , was a box - office disappointment ) . quick cuts and pretty sunrises can \\' t even begin to cover up this movie \\' s flaws . the main character ( and i use that term lightly , since no one in wild things shows more than an occasional flash of personality ) is sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) , a guidance counselor at florida \\' s blue bay high school . a student , the deliciously curvaceous kelly van ryan ( denise richards ) , has a crush on him . one afternoon , she comes to his house to wash his car , and , when she leaves , her clothing is torn . after confessing to her mother ( theresa russell ) that she was raped , she goes to the police station , where she tells her story to detectives ray duquette ( kevin bacon ) and gloria perez ( daphne rubin - vega ) . they are skeptical about here claims until another girl , suzie toller ( neve campbell ) , comes forward with a similar tale . meanwhile , sam , convinced that he \\' s being set up , goes to a shyster lawyer ( bill murray ) for help . the acting in wild things isn \\' t very good , but none of the principals have much to work with . this is definitely not a character - based motion picture . not only does the ludicrous screenplay ignore the possibility that someone in the audience may have a triple - digit i . q . , but it doesn \\' t bother to give any of the on - screen individuals even a hint of depth . the men and women populating the picture are there to look nice , but nothing more . matt dillon is given plenty of opportunities to flex his biceps . neve campbell gets to model the slutty look . denise richards strikes a fetching pose in a see - through , one - piece bathing suit . and nothing in the film gets a rise out of kevin bacon . the only one who \\' s even remotely interesting is bill murray , and he seems to think he \\' s in comedy , not a thriller ( maybe he \\' s got the right idea ) . columbia pictures has specifically requested that critics not reveal the film \\' s ending , which prompts the question : which ending do they want kept secret ? wild things has no less than three ( one occurs during the end credits , so stay seated ) , all of which are jaw - droppingly absurd -- a feat that joe eszterhas ( the writer of basic instinct and showgirls ) would be impressed by . thanks to jeffrey kimball \\' s polished , kinetic cinematography , wild things always looks great , and george s . clinton \\' s score keeps it pulsing and throbbing . but , no matter how shiny the superficial sheen is , this is still trash , and , like all garbage , it stinks .',\n",

       " ('note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . be forewarned . the teaser trailers for my best friend \\' s wedding scarsely gave reason for hope - it looked like the sort of goofy , light - hearted comedy than might put julia roberts back in the limelight , but little more ; i \\' d frankly rarely seen a trailer place such an emphasis on people falling over for laughs so often . it was then to both my surprise and my delight to find that my best friend \\' s wedding was such a success - a strong , bouyant romantic - comedy with some decidedly unconventionally quirky comic aspects , featuring a triumphant performance from ms . roberts . the heroine of my best friend \\' s wedding is julianne potter ( julia roberts ) , a successful new york restaurant critic , and we open the film with a whimsical revelation to her editor george downes ( rupert everett ) that years ago , she had made a pact with her dear best friend and ex - lover michael o \\' neal ( dermot mulroney ) , a sports writer , that if they both hadn \\' t married by the time they reached 28 , they had promised to marry each other . both julianne and michael are both single , of course , and when george inquires about michael \\' s age , julianne realizes that he \\' s mere weeks away from his 28th birthday , and is quite distressed when she receives a phone call from michael later that day . however , she finds herself even more distraught when michael \\' s call is in regards to his impending marriage to heiress kimmy wallace ( cameron diaz ) , and when he asks julianne to fly down to chicago for the wedding , julianne suddenly realizes that she loves michael , and resolves to break up the wedding and steal the groom by any means necessary . the setup for my best friend \\' s wedding , then , is a fairly conventional one , and in many ways the film \\' s storyline is formulaic - but only to a certain extent : the film was directed by p . j . hogan , whose first feature , muriel \\' s wedding , had quite an offbeat tone for a traditional uplifting ugly - duckling story , and the same holds true for my best friend \\' s wedding , which confidently combines traditional romantic - comedy elements with a really eccentric sense of humour . the film is innundated with sly mischievousness which seems clearly the influence of mr . hogan . for example , there \\' s a heartfelt , emotional exchange between julianne and michael late in the film - with a trio of teenagers , inhaling helium and sounding every bit like alvin and the chipmunks , harmonizing in the background . my best friend \\' s wedding opens with an inspired opening credit sequence which sets the tone for the film , and there are scenes where actors spontaneously burst into song to good comic effect - it could almost be argued that this film is nearly as much of a musical as woody allen \\' s everyone says i love you ; i \\' d even assert it \\' s a more successful one . my best friend \\' s wedding keeps breaking conventionality with its characters as well . in a typical romantic - comedy , kimmy would be portrayed as a snooty , conniving ice queen , and the audience would be cheering for julianne to rescue michael from her grasps ; this film is smarter than that - here , kimmy is sweet , sincere , and innocent ; julianne even admits at one point that had she not resolved to utterly destroy kimmy \\' s life , she \\' d actually like her too . the george character is almost a staple of recent film - the homosexual male friend of the heroine who acts as a confidant and provides the guiding voice of reason - but in my best friend \\' s wedding , he gets to have a playful , mischievous and charming personality . throughout the film , the formulaisms one often sees is romantic - comedy are given little twists , and the result is a film which is compelling all the way to its somewhat unorthodox conclusion . there is a lot of smart writing in the well - paced screenplay by ronald bass ; we \\' re given four interesting , vivid , and likeable characters , with some good dialogue and some genuinely charming and touching moments . my best friend \\' s wedding marks a strong career rebound for julia roberts , who turns in a top - notch , confident and reassured performance as julianne . this isn \\' t the sort of role one usually associates with ms . roberts - the julianne character \\' s neurotic , fumbling characteristics are more in line with a meg ryan role - but ms . roberts works wonderfully in the film and demonstrates her aptitude at comedy here , remaining compelling and empathetic to the audience , if not entirely sympathetic , even when her deeds done to destroy the wedding plans of her best friend are less than honourable . even better than ms . roberts though is cameron diaz , who turns in a shining performance in my best friend \\' s weddding . with a smile which lights up the screen , she effectively conveys kimmy \\' s insecurity and utter sweetness in an endearing manner , and never hits a false note in the film . she even sings - i won \\' t soon forget her charming serenade of \" i just don \\' t know what to do with myself \" . rupert everett is given a very juicy role as george , and he makes the most of it with a hilarious turn which makes his character perhaps the most vivid and most memorable in the film . his george is a bit of a devilish rogue , entirely affable , and mr . everett \\' s performance is a delight to watch ; he \\' s clearly having fun , and his joy is infectuous . dermot mulroney is adequate in a thankless role - unlike the other characters in the film , he \\' s not given a lot to do , but there is a genuine onscreen chemistry between ms . roberts and mr . mulroney , and consequently the longstanding friendship between his michael character and the julianne character always seemed completely authentic . when julia roberts \\' lustre began to fade , and she was usurped from her title as \" america \\' s sweetheart \" by sandra bullock , i thought it was a canny career move on her part to take supporting roles in prestige projects like michael collins and everyone says i love you to raise her profile . while that didn \\' t quite work out , it \\' s near - certain that her successful return to the genre which made her a big star back in 1990 , the romantic - comedy , will once again raise her ante in the hollywood game . my best friend \\' s wedding marks a return to form for ms . roberts , and cements p . j . hogan \\' s reputation as a skilled director of comedy .',\n",

       " ('the lives of older people in the twilight of their years attempting to come to grips with their shared histories and possible futures is a fascinating topic . finding an all - star cast for such a film is a stroke of genius . combining all that with a three - time oscar - winning director ( robert benton of \" kramer vs . kramer \" ) and creating a decidedly mediocre movie is the stuff of disappointment . in yet another noir mystery set in hollywood -- how many of these have we seen during the past few years ? -- the atmosphere is moody , the actors enjoyable to watch and the story goes nowhere . over - 70 harry ross ( paul newman ) is a washed up cop - turned - private eye - turned man friday trying to figure out how to live what remains of his life . he \\' s screwed up things pretty well ( \" i had a wife and daughter . now , i \\' m a drunk ) and is at a crossroads . a couple of years ago , he traveled to mexico to bring back mel ( reese witherspoon ) , the under - age daughter of jack ( gene hackman ) and catherine ( susan sarandon ) ames and now lives with them . the ames are former movie stars , past their prime and the three have become fast friends . one gets the impression that ross is just hanging out waiting for something to wake him up . to fill his time , he does odd jobs for jack and falls in love with catherine . jack is in even worse shape than harry . he \\' s dying of cancer with only a year to live . things do turn more exciting when jack asks harry to drop off a sealed manila envelope for him . instead of the routine errand that ross expects , he walks into a barrage of bullets from the gun of another ex - cop who is , himself , full of bloody holes . this unsettling event gives the former detective a project to throw himself into and launches an investigation that revolves around the mysterious disappearance of catherine \\' s first husband 20 years before . through a series of very complex and convoluted plot devices that involve murder ; blackmail ; guns ; mel \\' s mexico traveling partner and his parole officer ; ross \\' s former cop buddies , ex - lover and would - be sidekick , the tale finally ends up exactly where everyone expects it to . it \\' s a film noir tradition that the story twists and turns down side roads for an unexpected finale , but here the journey meanders towards an ending that no one cares about . the only surprises are exactly whose face fits which role in the scenario . by the time they show you , it doesn \\' t matter . the storyline gets goofier and goofier exemplified in ross \\' s relationship with rubin ( giancarlo esposito ) , a partner wannabe . these scenes are obviously designed to be comic relief , however they are neither . rubin and ross have some past relationship but either it \\' s not explained or i didn \\' t care enough at that point to remember . a running joke about where harry was supposedly shot while in mexico is probably meant to mirror his questions about whether he is still able to perform . it \\' s also not funny , doesn \\' t connect and keeps on showing up long after it has run its course . on the positive side , it \\' s often enjoyable to watch the seasoned actors on the screen . the three leads all have well - deserved academy awards and turn in accomplished , if not extraordinary jobs . newman is a grand actor , but doesn \\' t seem quite suited to the dark film style . he is a bit too clean and understated to come across as desperate and down and out . hackman , also low - key , is believable but lacks sparkle . sarandon comes across well as an sultry older babe although she is one - dimensional . the actors do what they can with lame dialog , but they can \\' t pull the film out of the hole it \\' s dug for itself . james garner who plays ross \\' s old buddy ex - cop raymond hope is always a treat , but even he half - heartedly struggles through lines like \" i \\' m glad they didn \\' t shoot your pecker off . \" the best part of the film is the look at old friends , how their relationships change over the years and the difficult choices they must make . the genuinely easy and casual interactions among the actors hint that being on the set was much more interesting than what ended up on the screen the film doesn \\' t run very long before the audience realizes that it \\' s hopeless . the only reason for watching is the actors . it reminds me of disaster movies such as \" towering inferno \" where the star power is supposed to make everyone ignore the film \\' s problems . in a better world , there would have been second - rate actors in this second - rate movie and the ones here would have been saved for something better . of course , we don \\' t live in that better world , but you could make yours a little nicer by choosing a different movie .',\n",

       " (\"this is the first film in what would become the most successful series of horror films of all time . a fair warning to those of you who might be inclined to watch this movie for the first appearance of everyone ' s favorite goalie - mask - wearing homicidal maniac . jason , the guy who single handedly controlled the overpopulation problem around the crystal lake area , doesn ' t start his quest to find the most interesting household item with which to kill someone until the sequel . while he does have a small role in this film , we the audience have to depend on another blood thirsty maniac to rack up the body count . the plot , like every other friday the 13th movie goes something like this -- crazed killer murders as many unsuspecting teenagers as he / she / it possibly can in the space of a 90 minute movie . the reasons that the afore mentioned unsuspecting teenagers come into contact with the bloodthirsty killer are usually of little importance to the story . but for those of you out there that might actually care about such trivial matters in a movie such as a plot , here are the basics . a bunch of unsuspecting teens get a summer job at a long closed summer camp . they are days away from the arrival of the kids and they are spending their time fixing the place up and making sure it is ready for the kids . sadly , they start being butchered one by one by the bloodthirsty killer . at this point i would usually say something about the quality of acting , directing or maybe something about the high quality of the production . since i ' m not going to do that , feel free to assume that if i did , it wouldn ' t be positive . i will say that this movie looks as if it was made for about a hundred bucks , and that includes the actors ' salaries . if you are used to recent horror films like scream , you are in for a bit of a surprise . the only saving grace for friday the 13th is that it was really the first of its kind , with the killer taking real pride in their work . using as many methods of murder as they could . none of this single murder weapon stuff life that unimaginative leatherface in chainsaw massacre , or the creatively stifled imagination of halloween ' s michael myers who just used brute force or a really big kitchen knife . nope , in the friday the 13th movies , you can always count on the killer taking great pride in his work . one fun fact about this movie is that the cast includes a very young kevin bacon , although after this movie it is a wonder he ever worked again . the main reason to see friday the 13th is if you want to watch all of the series from the beginning . if not , stick with the later films with jason , everyone ' s favorite hockey fan . friday the 13th is the sort of movie that is fun to sit down and get a couple of scares from , just don ' t sit down expecting a whole lot .\",\n",

( never mind that the ba \\' ku didn \\' t exactly evolve - they went wandering in the universe one day and stumbled upon the magic world . ) every time frakes gives an interview lately , he seems to top whatever ludicrous statement he last gave regarding this installment . he has called it a comedy , a thinking man \\' s picture , a throwback to the old series , and , most grievously , he has likened it to a john ford western . ( i presume that \\' s some john ford he went to school with , not the director of the searchers . ) he has also gone on record as saying paramount recut the film from his version . that \\' s no excuse - someone generated this footage . muddy cinematography and sitcom sets are the least of its problems ; star trek : insurrection appears to have been beamed in from the planet plotholia . consider such curiosities . . . picard \\' s love interest , anij ( donna murphy ) , can slow things down by staring at them ( such as a waterfall or falling rocks ) - her scientific explanation for this ? \" don \\' t ask . \" worf gets a pimple ( he \\' s re - experiencing klingon puberty thanks to the time - defying atmosphere ) , laforge regains his eyesight ( trust me , levar burton \\' s real eyes are scarier than those electronic lenses he wore in first contact ) and troi brags about her firm boobs , but picard remains as bald as an android \\' s butt . most suspiciously , what exactly is the problem with letting this endangered race have a little fun in the sun ? the filmmakers cloud the issue with some nonsense about a family feud of sorts , and they also turn ru \\' afo into a completely power - mad superfreak , just so the characters will have something to do in the climax . ( and if you \\' ve seen return of the jedi , you \\' ve seen the ending of this movie . ) didn \\' t picard himself previously disobey the prime directive when he prevented the borg from assimilating millions ? frakes lucked out with first contact , and repeat viewings of that film reveal the seeds of what went wrong in his direction of insurrection : he has no sense of comic timing , and he mines for acting chemistry where none exists . ( take a look at the painful \" troi gets drunk \" scene in fc and you \\' ll get the general idea of insurrection \\' s unsuccessfully jokey and hollow tone . ) even the worst shatner and co . treks , like the final frontier , maintained a watchability thanks to the effortless , charming comaraderie between kirk , spock , and bones . neither first contact nor insurrection has any idea what to do with crusher ( gates mcfadden , whom i must say maintains a fabulous physique ) , troi , or laforge . and all three next generation films spend too much time on data , who is the franchise \\' s answer to urkel . need a cheap laugh ? have data say something sexual , or start singing , or lift up a four hundred pound boulder as if it \\' s the hunk of styrofoam it really is . here \\' s my proposed title for number 10 : data star data trek : data data data data data . in this movie , data will become preoccupied with learning to blow his nose , while crusher and troi watch silently from 500 yards away and laforge points his sinister gaze at the android in doubly robotic observation . star trek : insurrection had one nice , eerie , silent moment that hints at a better , darker film . i \\' m not saying all of them should be star trek ii : the wrath of khan , but this one boldly went where no movie should go again .',\n",

( we \\' ve made it thru comparison # 1 ! ) jackie is a 44 - year - old airline stewardess who brings in extra cash , and probably her main revenue , by smuggling large sums of money into the united states for ordell robbie ( pulp fiction \\' s samuel l . jackson and comparison # 2 ) . ordell is in the illegal firearms business and has enlisted the aid of louis gara ( robert de niro ) , a bank robber who just got out of prison after serving four years , to help him accomplish a scheme worth a half - million dollars . trouble arises when jackie is stopped by atf agent ray nicolet ( michael keaton ) and taken into custody for possession of narcotics , as well as having more money than is allowed in an airport without being claimed . naturally this proves an obstacle to ordell \\' s plans and , not as friendly intended as we \\' d hope , he posts jackie \\' s bail after she is put behind bars . the thing is , ordell is in this for no one more than himself , and as we learn from his previous actions , he \\' s willing to kill anyone who stands in the way . jackie finds herself in a tight squeeze . ordell won \\' t think twice about taking her out if she fails to help him as she \\' s always done , yet at the same time , a compromise with the authorities would be in order if evidence against ordell was provided . it comes down to a simple question : would jackie rather face ordell or prison ? what ensues is a rich and intriguing example of storytelling as we question who jackie is really out to help : the law , ordell , or maybe just herself . coming into play is another 70 \\' s veteran , robert forster as jackie \\' s bail bondsmen max cherry . max \\' s obvious fondness for jackie will become a major benefactor in her fight to beat both sides of the system , and forster plays him with subtle charm that adds depth to unbrewed romance . also involved is ordell \\' s \" surfer girl \" girlfriend melanie ( bridget fonda ) , a ditzy sun - bleached babe who spends her time watching tv with a bong in hand . fonda does the best she can with an essentially thin role , but there \\' s nothing more to her , and therefore , she becomes a tossable addition to an otherwise flourishing bouquet of characters . de niro is also wasted in his role as a quiet nobody crook out to score a few bucks for himself . de niro is a brilliant actor , but a character who hardly ever speaks doesn \\' t need a de niro to play him . compared to pulp fiction ( comparison # 3 ) , the characters in jackie brown and very thin and replaceable . in pulp fiction , even the small , seemingly irrelevant characters were wonderful , complete , and lifelike , whereas jackie brown has such common figures that it wouldn \\' t have suffered much with a lesser talented cast , the exception being grier . tarantino wrote this script with grier specifically in mind , so to say that she is made for this role is a reversed truth . sadly , grier too could have received a bit more attention , especially when the story is all about her newly - jarred perception of life . jackson teams up with tarantino again , but the chemical reaction isn \\' t as awesome as the first time . jules was the rambling , bible - quoting hitman in pulp fiction , and jackson is the only person who could have pulled it off . and although jackson is really , really good in jackie brown , i don \\' t think he \\' s quite as irreplaceable . in fact , maybe a new face would have been better . jackson could \\' ve remained tarantino \\' s jules , and a new guy could have become ordell , forever to remain so in our memories . sadly , these characters are too much the same , except ordell just isn \\' t as impressive , and putting this in the hands of jackson once again is only going to deter from our fond recollections of jules . another problem is that ordell is way too focused on in the beginning . this is grier \\' s film , so why spend so long getting to know a man who will become more of a supporting character as the film progresses ? it not only makes the movie feel a little too slanted , but it makes for a slow beginning because we have to take longer getting to the meat of the story . it is likely that those pouring into the theater to see this film are going to be those anxious to partake of tarantino \\' s quirky dialogue and eccentric directing style , and not so much those interested in seeing a silver screen adaption of elmore leonard \\' s novel \" rum punch \" . for those movie - goers , don \\' t expect another pulp fiction and you \\' ll be satisfied , for the script oozes with the familiar brash qualities that has made tarantino an icon of 90 \\' s film - making . the directing has toned down a bit , however , yet we \\' re still reminded that this is tarantino \\' s movie thanks to odd split - screen story - telling devices and scenes being replayed multiple times from different viewpoints . so getting back to the question that i began with , this isn \\' t pulp fiction at all . it \\' s good , but it isn \\' t anything that made pulp fiction such a revolutionary effort in the first place . this is a more conservative tarantino , but not one that won \\' t satiate true fans . if you can realize that this isn \\' t going to knock your socks off , then you \\' ll be happy to at least let it massage your feet . after all , we all know how much tarantino loves that particular part of the human anatomy .',\n",

       " ('the postman delivers but not first class the postman a film review by michael redman copyright 1997 by michael redman [ warning : my opinion of this film is definitely in the minority of reviewers perhaps because it hits so many of my cinematic buttons : post - apocalypse stories , hope in a desperate situation , grassroots uprisings and kevin costner . even worse , i thought that \" waterworld \" was watchable . read the following with those particular grains of salt . ] it \\' s the year 2013 and things have fallen apart . due to a world war in the late nineties , the resulting three - year winter and a devastating plague , life in the former united states has been reduced to isolated primitive fiefdoms . although this is the future , it looks like a western . as the film opens , kevin costner ( his character \\' s name is never revealed ) is wandering the utah wastelands with only his mule bill for company . giving extraordinarily bad shakespearean performances in exchange for food and lodging , costner is an outsider in a land of outsiders . running into even worse luck , he is forcibly conscripted into the racially pure holnist army of general bethlehem ( will patton ) . the rag - tag retro - futuristic cavalry is the descendent of militia groups and is even called the \" clan \" after a brutal boot camp , he ( and you can see this coming a mile away ) escapes . taking shelter in a wrecked postal truck , he liberates the uniform and mail bag from the skeleton in the cab who no longer has a use for either . once he reaches oregon , land of beautiful women , bright youngsters and rock and roll ; he pretends to be a representative from the \" restored congress of the united states of america \" . this scam gets him inside the walled towns where the promise of mail delivery renews optimism in the hearts of the inhabitants . food and other opportunities come his way in the form of spirited abby ( olivia williams ) who wants him to father a child because her husband is sterile . shortly her husband is killed by bethlehem and she and the postman ( as costner is referred to for the rest of the film ) become a reluctant item . although the postman knows he \\' s running a fraud , the concept of renewed communications sets the kids \\' imagination afire ( especially ford lincoln mercury ( larenz tate ) , his second - in - command ) and they form a new pony express dedicated to getting the mail through . the revived postal service doubles as an army to fight the holnists \\' tyranny . the postman has become a symbol for hope in a rube goldberg manner . although the movie appeals to my sensibilities , there are so many things wrong with it that they can hardly be counted . it \\' s derivitive of costner \\' s own \" waterworld \" and clint eastwood westerns . there \\' s little here that we haven \\' t seen dozens of times before . the film is often down - right corny . a scene where the postman is on horseback and grabs a letter from the hands of a bright - eyed child is embarrassing in its slow - motion banality . the film \\' s final few minutes should have been left on the cutting room floor . despite the film \\' s excessive three hour length , several things are never explained . what was the war about ? how did civilization change so rapidly ? everyone has horses : where did all they come from ? the \" law of eights \" that bethlehem lives by seems to have its origins somewhere beyond the film , but where ? are we to believe that the rest of the world is in the same shape and hasn \\' t made their way west to help or conquer ? there is some jumbled symbolism here that doesn \\' t appear to make sense . the tale is obviously saying that communication can defeat evil in much the same way that the internet has the potential to topple governments , but beyond that there are some oddities . the evil army is called \" holnists \" which sounds coincidentally like the new age \" holism \" , but why ? is it another coincidence that it takes place in 2013 , just one year after many ancient prophesies ( including the ending of the mayan calendar ) predict a new world for mankind ? why is the general named \" bethlehem \" ? there seems to be some reason for that , but what ? sometimes the movie feels like a joke . an army of postal workers armed with guns ? considering the headlines of recent years , it takes a tremendous leap of faith to cheer for these guys . it \\' s even more difficult to accept those re - powering the federal government as the heroes . given the current climate of the country and the distrust of big government , it \\' s asking a lot for the audience to get behind the film \\' s nationalism . even with its numerous flaws , the movie all comes together , if only for those who have the same weaknesses that i have . it \\' s doubtful that \" the postman \" is going to find much of an audience , but a few of us are going to have a good time . besides we \\' re all awaiting the fall of civilization caused by the year 2000 millennium computer bug . ( michael redman has written this column for over 22 years and would like to announce that the \" michael redman \" arrested near indianapolis last week for accepting an illicit package from federal express is , to the best of his knowledge , not him . perhaps this similarly - named person should have used kevin costner \\' s postal service . )',\n",

what a cast . ok here is the plot in this movie : linda fiorentino plays a regular woman who works at an abortion clinic . one day at her house metatron ( the voice of god ) appears at her house much to her surprise and tells her that she must stop two fallen angels ( matt damon and ben affleck ) from getting back into heaven by ways of a church . ok now get this , she is told to find two prophets : one who talks a lot and one who doesn ' t , however she gets jay and silent bob instead ( who give us great performances ) . now on her way to new jersey with jay and silent bob to try and stop the two angels the 13th apostle falls out of the sky ( chris rock ) and helps guide her to find these angels . salma hayek plays serendipity who also helps her out along her way . azrael ( jason lee ) who is a demon is trying to help the two angels out so that they can win . bethany ( linda fiorentino ) has to now use the help of all these people to try and stop the angels before they cheat their way back to heaven leading to a violent and bloody end that will make you think twice about your faith . what a movie , it is everything rolled into one : an offensive , offbeat , smart and sassy comedy that surprisingly has a great message at the end , and ends up being a feel - good movie . who would have known kevin had such a soft side on him that could make us know that he is a faithful person himself . now for those of you who get offended with this movie really should not take it to heart . yes it may target the catholic community and bash them a lot , but it also seems to rather than go against god and heaven , it actually goes with god and kevin gives a message that there is a god . this review may sound confusing at first but really the only way to understand it is to see this excellent movie . kevin goes to new lengths in this hilarious comedy and gives us some great characters with not too much background or study and rather we start to know the characters as we watch the movie . of course the best ( and funniest ) of them all is the only duo in history that have made me fall out of my chair laughing and that my friends are jay and silent bob . probably the best characters in movies that i like . the star - studded cast is amazing and has some other cameos by george carlin , jeanne garafolo and so may more that we start to lose track after a while . the script was written by kevin smith with many f ' words in there of course and a strong emphasis on sexual talk but he also seems to concentrate on what is important rather that what isn ' t and makes us laugh at the same time as we think . chris rock gives a hilarious performance and gets into his character very well , with some classic lines . linda fiorentino is just perfect for her role and makes us believe that she really is who she is . of course jason mewes and kevin smith do a great job as jay and silent bob with some priceless lines from jay ( as well as silent bob ) . alan rickman , jason lee , salma hayek round out the cast with matt damon and ben affleck in the starring roles . being oscar winners for the classic ' good will hunting ' they give great performances here again but matt damon seems just a little held back and to me did not give it all he could . ben however was all out and got very much into his character as well as the story . the movie ' s only big flaw is that it has a few unfunny lines and some slow parts to go along with it . however the direction by kevin and the script by kevin as well as the priceless performance by many of the cast members , ' dogma ' stands as a new classic and i think i can safely compare it to ' clerks ' . while being funny at times , in the end it becomes a serious movie with an important message that some may not agree with but can ' t deny it . ' dogma ' will offend people , especially deeply religious people , but for those of you who are open minded and want to see some very funny material then this is the movie for you . all kevin smith fans must see ! !\",\n",

       " (\"accepting his oscar as producer of this year ' s best picture winner , saul zaentz remarked that his cup runneth over . one could almost say the same about his much - prized film . rarely is the screen so overflowing with potent imagery , symbolism , ideas and metaphors , complex and literate storytelling , all possessed of an intelligence that invites -- even demands -- constant scrutiny , an acuity of perception and observation that must somehow yield the truth . in short , the antithesis of all things hollywood . yet this surfeit of signals is made to serve a rather pale and thinly realized love story whose emotional impact is as dry as a desert wind . ralph fiennes is the title character , an amnesiac burn victim whose gradual return to memory , and particularly the memory of love , is the ostensible focus of the film . but despite the use of numerous flashbacks to help put the pieces of this personal puzzle together , we never learn enough about the man to feel much empathy for him . his emotional life before the story begins is an essential clue that remains withheld . the same can easily be said for every other character in the film , of which there are too many . juliette binoche ' s nurse comes as close as this film gets to an emotional heart . at least we learn early on that she is scarred by the deaths of those close to her , and so we understand why she is eager to escape the company of her comrades in order to seek refuge in the convalescence of a mysterious , disfigured , dying stranger . even this information is imparted so quickly and in such cursory fashion , however , that it verges on the comical . with so many characters enjoying so little screen time , the film ' s 160 minutes can be taxing . yet there is something so captivating about the sensibility behind the camera that i couldn ' t help but feel that greatness was in the air . hints of it were everywhere -- in a man who hates ownership but wants desperately to possess his lover ; in ancient cave paintings of swimmers copied casually by a modern - day swimmer in the sahara ; in the way the shifting sands of time obliterate everything more completely than a world war . there is enough latent meaning to supply college film students with paper topics for years . but ultimately the emotional truths writer - director anthony minghella was grasping for were never revealed . in the end , i was left with the impression that i had witnessed quite an oxymoron : a haunting bore . bore is perhaps too strong a word . but after drinking in the rich production values , the cup remains only slightly over half - full .\",\n",

       " ('there are some works of art that are almost impossible to review , not because of their own complexity , but because of their legendary status which prevents the reviewer to say anything original . one of such masterpieces is casablanca , probably not the best film in the history of the seventh art , but definitely the most popular one . its popularity can be measured not in a multitude of more or less disguised remakes that were made in more than half a century since its premiere , but also in countless tributes and references that movie makers use in their works to this day . casablanca is also a movie that has the very rare virtue of both being praised by the critics and loved by general audience . one of the things that makes this film even more unique was the fact that it was doomed to fail , at least judging by conventional movie - making wisdom of its time . it was based on a broadway play so mediocre that it hadn \\' t been produced on stage ; screenplay by three writers - julius g . epstein , philip j . epstein and howard koch - was beeing written as shooting went along ; the main actors were producers \\' second choice , and , finally , man behind camera , michael curtiz was considered to be capable , but not great director . however , the movie was commercially successful and earned three \" oscars \" , including the one for the best film . until this very day , it is considered to be the best example of hollywood film - making in its own golden age . the plot of the movie was heavily influenced by the needs of ww2 propaganda , yet it also used rather complicated and now almost forgotten political circumstances of that global conflict in order to make intriguing story . in december 1941 , casablanca , exotic port on the atlantic coast of north africa is controlled by officially neutral , yet nazi - collaborating french vichy government . thousands of refugees from war - torn europe are stuck there on the way to lisbon and safety of america , and ready to pay any price for precious exit visas . many shady characters thrive on their misery , including the corrupt police chief , captain renault ( rains ) . his best friend is rick blaine ( bogart ) , who used to be idealistic anti - fascist , and now owns popular night club in casablanca and lives by his own cynical philosophy of \" sticking his neck for nobody \" . however , everything changes when he gets in possession of two precious extra visas . this event coincides with the arrival of two new refugees to casablanca . one of them is victor laszlo ( henreid ) , czech resistance leader who escaped three times from nazi concentration camps and became the legend of enslaved europe . he is accompanied by his beautiful wife ilsa lund ( bergman ) , with whom rick had a stormy affair in the eve of nazi occupation of paris . the couple needs visas , especially because of the gestapo major strasser ( veidt ) being on their trail . rick is now forced to choose between love , wounded pride , self - preserving interest and his own hatred of fascism . the casting for this movie seems influenced by divine inspiration - humphrey bogart , most legendary actor in the history of cinema , is one of the rare character actors who elevated his persona to the star status . bogart \\' s portrayal of rick as complicated man , torn between idealistic past and bitter present , was so perfect , that his icon would forever be connected with that character . another icon in his company is ingrid bergman , great actress of old hollywood , here in her artistic and visual prime . the cinematic coupling of bogart and bergman became one of the main symbols of that era of filmmaking - some happier times when the romance on the screen didn \\' t look childish nor trite like in some more contemporary works . for many people , casablanca is probably the best romantic film ever made . but the reason for that isn \\' t the romance itself - it \\' s the realistic story of people forced to make tough , and often wrong choices in their life . the casting of casablanca was right on target not just in a case of main leads . the supporting actors also did a marvellous job . sidney longstreet and peter lorre were here mainly to give a mystic flavour spotted in a previous bogart classic - john huston \\' s maltese falcon ; yet both of them managed to portray colourful and original characters . another shining example of good casting is now almost forgotten paul henreid as the weakest part of love triangle ; character of victor laszlo has believable charisma and looks like a somebody who could inspire millions of people to rise against nazi tiranny . unfortunately , the charisma that burdened laszlo , leaves little place for difficult choice , making his character forever overshadowed by rick / ilsa coupling . however , rick and ilsa actually have a serious competiton for most memorable character in casablanca . captain renault , brilliantly portrayed by claude rains in a role of a lifetime , was embodiment of perfect , almost unmatched balance between ethical corruption and physical charm . despite being the undoubtful villain in almost entire movie , rains managed to make renault sympathetic character , and his final conversion to the side of good , symbolized in not so subtle gesture at the end of movie looked unnecessary . rains also gave another dimension to the movie , making it even more ambiguous ; people who like to analyse movies to death discovered signs of homosexuality in renault \\' s relationship towards rick , and rick \\' s final words leave room for even more outrageous speculations . together with well - drawn characters and exciting story , the movie was good in creating his own atmosphere . professional nitpickers would probably have a field day in discovering numerous historical and geographical inaccuracies , but casablanca is still a shining example of hollywood ww2 movie that is beliavable , if not realistic . any way , even if we don \\' t see it as a historical document , casablanca is movie that can be source of entertainment as well as infinite inspiration .',\n",

       " ('note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . be forewarned . east meets west in mulan , the latest installment in disney \\' s parade of annual animated feature films . an odd fusion of ancient asian traditions and disconcerting elements which betray obvious mass - market commercial sensibilities , this confident entry is easily the most engaging and satisfying hollywood animated feature in years , but falls short of actualizing its potential . though not for lack of trying . in many respects , mulan is among disney \\' s most mature efforts , skirting the surface of adult themes and daring to sneak glimpses into the messier side of combat . the violence of the battles in the film are admittedly sanitized -- the imagery of a pillaged village , neatly encapsulated in the form of a child \\' s discarded doll , is in itself no more harrowing than luke discovering his fallen guardians in star wars , and mulan \\' s later heroics in dispatching of the ruthless invaders is done so in the most tidy , bloodless method imaginable -- yet how often does a hollywood animated film , long considered as the last safe refuge for the innocent , dare touch upon the consequential horrors of war in such a provocative manner ? in an instant , idealistic mulan \\' s innocence is lost , and her jovial squadron are reminded of what their efforts are spent defending . the film , based upon an ancient chinese fable , centers on a spirited young woman who disguises herself as a man in order to serve as her family \\' s obligatory conscript when china finds itself under attack by huns ( cartoonishly depicted by easy demonic overtones , replete with glowing yellow eyes and dagger - edged teeth , although lent a surprisingly genuine sense of menace ) . dipping into the mythology of other cultures for the first time after cavorting in animated revisitings of familiar western / european fables and literature for decades , disney \\' s new film is boldly set in ancient china rather than relocated elsewhere , story intact , to some neutral territory , and revels in its east asian roots ; aside from a predominantly asian - american cast providing the film \\' s vocal work , there \\' s liberal usage of oriental iconography throughout , and the artwork reveal hints of japanese anime influence . while the film does occasionally reach its limits and starts to tread upon old stereotypes -- invoking pseudo - asian references to items like beancurd and rice in every third sentence grows rather hoary , and i can \\' t imagine that the regiment for ancient chinese warriors * really * included karate - chopping blocks of stone in two -- it \\' s rather remarkable that a movie primarily positioned for american and european audiences delves so wholeheartedly into new foreign territory . the film also freely touches upon cultural idiosyncrasies from its outset ; although savvy viewers should easily pick up on the intrinsics immediately , it \\' s startlingly assertive in providing as little shorthand as it does to unfamiliar youngsters with regards to the customs and traditions of mulan \\' s land . at its core , the film is a tale of heroic adventure , and as such paints its story in bold strokes of honour , perseverance , nobility and courage . as such , animation is the perfect vehicle for this flavour of epic , where stark emotional simplicity is able to effectively work hand - in - hand with visual purity . scenes which would play out as unbearably hokey in live action , such as mulan \\' s venerable father pridefully tossing aside his cane when accepting his draft notice , are lent a sense of strength and conveyed with greater emotional clarity in animation . mulan capitalizes on this during its strongest moments , particularly during our heroine \\' s character - defining opening half - hour . it \\' s when the film attempts to integrate the traditional mainstays of recent hollywood animation -- the friendly animal sidekick , the colourful array of supporting characters -- into the mix where it goes slightly awry . off to battle , mulan finds herself being trailed by a jive - talking diminutive dragon called mushu and an agreeable little \" lucky \" cricket , who ostensibly appear to assist in her subterfuge and realistically serve as audience - friendly comic relief . they \\' re affable presences , and not precisely ineffective -- reasonable amounts of humour are elicited , and eddie murphy ( who voices mushu ) is amusingly earnest -- but amidst all the high melodrama , the effect is mildly jarring and , from a storytelling perspective , questionable in its necessity . at training camp , mulan antagonizes and eventually wins over a trio of fumbling recruits ( easily characterized simply as the short clown , the skinny clown , and the big clown ) , who provide more levity into the film with decidedly less effectiveness , and , in a familiar retread of traditional disney patterns , she grows a certain fondness for a handsome , square - jawed young captain , shang . everybody needs love , even ancient chinese warrior princesses , but not necessarily in * this * film . the romantic angle , which lets the air out of the sails of the story \\' s neo - feminist underpinnings , lacks any genuine spark and plays out like a contractual obligation . another staple of recent disney animated films , a cache of hummable little ditties , has also obligingly been carried over to mulan but proves to be a decided weakness . composed by matthew wilder , none of the handful of tunes are particularly distinguishing , and one -- \" i \\' ll make a man out of you \" ( unimaginatively accompanying a tired montage featuring our crew of characters transforming into lean fighting machines ) -- becomes so grating and hackneyed that it seems almost interminable . only \" reflections \" , an early ballad of lament , proves to be a song of any consequence , serving as an effective showcase for lea salonga , one of musical theatre \\' s most wondrously pure voices . nonetheless , mulan is an especially appealing piece of work from the disney factory , with a strong narrative arc and pleasant artwork ; the computer - generated stampede of hun warriors charging down a snow mountain is wholly impressive . while the blatantly child - friendly elements at times seem incongruous with the remainder of the film , they \\' re not dissuasive and remain fairly enjoyable . briskly paced with a smart , energetic heroine and filled with high adventure , the film is ultimately most satisfying on the intimate scale of father and daughter .',\n",

       " ('renown surrealist director , the 77 - year - old frenchman alain resnais ( hiroshima , mon amour / last year at marienbad / m ? lo ) , has created a lighthearted musical played as an homage to britisher dennis potter and his pennies from heaven ( 1978 tv serial , 1981 movie ) and the singing detective ( 1986 ) . the film follows potter \\' s gimmicky style of having the characters jump into lip - synched old or contemporary french pop songs to express their private thoughts . he also follows the kind of sweet and colorful musicals his fellow countryman jacques demy loved to direct , such as \" the umbrellas of cherbourg \" and \" the young girls of rochefort . \" the tale has resnais \\' s unique touches as a director to go along with his homage . it is a satire about class differences and falling in love with the wrong person , and that there is a song in everyone \\' s heart for every occasion . what hinders this production is that the stars are not portraying particularly engaging characters , the songs are not memorable and stand little chance of being recognized by an american audience ( the exceptions might be the edith piaf and maurice chevalier numbers ) , and the farce seems more banal than daring . yet it is not without its striking moments and charms , such as when jane birkin does a cameo and sings one of her own songs . also , the glossy amberlike photography added a very french romantic feeling to the story , while the mood of paris as being a place for love to flourish above all else , which has always been embellished in movie lore , comes through with flying colors . it also does a good job of showing you the way paris is in the 1990s and in the way ordinary people exist there . it tells the romantic story of six parisians who become intertwined with each other in their ordinary lives as they search for happiness . they are the attractive sisters odile ( sabine az ? ma ) and camille ( agnes jaoui ) , with the older businesswoman odile married and decidedly set on a bourgeois life of material comforts . she is married to the glum and laconic claude ( pierre arditi ) . she once went out with a businessman , nicolas ( jean - pierre bacri ) , who left her 8 - years ago and now shows up in paris and asks her help to find someone to rent a flat for his family . simon ( andre dussolier ) works as a real - estate salesman and is trying to find nicolas a flat , in his spare time he writes radio plays . simon \\' s boss is the much younger , unscrupulous and arrogant marc duveyrier ( lambert wilson ) , who inherited the firm from his father and is the real - estate agent selling a more luxurious and larger flat with a better view to odile , but fails to tell her that a building project is going up soon that will block her view . screenwriters and actors jean - pierre bacri and agnes jaoui wrote themselves the best parts . jaoui \\' s camille is a university scholar finishing up a ph . d . in history , using for her thesis the study of \\' the yeomen in the year 1000 at lake paladru . \\' she works as a tour guide in the meantime and suffers from panic attacks , even though she appears to have outwardly perfect self - control . on her tours for the last four years has been the much older simon , pretending to be doing research for his plays but really attracted to her , but not having the nerve to tell her this . to his dismay , he finds out she is dating his mean - spirited but handsome boss , whom she meets when looking at her sister \\' s new place and seeing him crying but not realizing that it was from a cold , not because he \\' s so sensitive . bacri as the classy nicolas , turns out to be now working as a chauffeur . he is a hypochondriac with a history of depression who visits many doctors , until he finds one who tells him there is nothing wrong with him . odile still pines for him , but he \\' s married , telling her he expects his wife to arrive shortly . love is \\' the same old song \\' that makes the world go \\' round , even when all the characters are liars and not exactly open to what their true motives are . everything comes together in a bourgeois housewarming party for odile \\' s place , as the characters reveal their true feelings and all their deceptions and neurotic impulses are either uncovered or about to be . there \\' s not a lot of bite to this satirical musical , but resnais has never made a bad film and is one of the best current french directors , if not the best . this film is not one his great ones , but it still has enough pep in its light touches to be interesting . it not only has an odd way for the characters to break into song but -- some males even sing in a female voice while some females sing in a male voice . it is also interesting in the way it examines its characters \\' behavior as being similar in business as in love .',\n",

       " (\"once upon a time jean - claude van damme was a decent action hero . the muscles from brussels bursted into the hollywood market with mindless adventure films , boasting his spectacular martial - arts ability . some of these excursions were fun . but now it seems like watching a van damme movie has become a painful chore , with no rewards but the virtually guaranteed helping of mind - numbing action . and when the action goes sour , what is there left to enjoy ? i ' ll explain . knock off is about a pair of counterfeit jeans salesmen working out of an office in hong kong . marcus ray ( van damme ) , a babe - magnet and stylish dresser , heads up the company with an annoying weasel of a partner ( rob schneider ) . they become part of a plot involving microbombs implanted in counterfeit jeans , seemingly by a mole in the business . i ' m going to reveal about everything in the next paragraph , so if you want a review devoid of spoilers , skip onto the next one . i ' m not quite sure who gives a crap , but i ' ll issue a warning anyhow . tommy is really working with the cia . his boss ( a very hammy and flat paul sorvino ) is the mole , and he wants to cause carnage with these tiny but immensely powerful super weapons . he even stoops so low to put them into children ' s toys . if you thought this plot outline sounded intriguing , then you probably will enjoy knock off . if you think that this ridiculous set - up couldn ' t even fill five minutes of screen time without causing you to roll over laughing , this might not be your cup of tea . knock off sucks . it stoops to ridiculous levels that most individuals could only conjure up in horrific nightmares . it amazes me how far these producers will go to sell something , simply because van damme is the star . the plot is pathetic garbage strung together by inane action sequences that will baffle your mind , the performances are so wooden you could use them to row a canoe , and the action itself is an absolute catastrophe . director tsui hark ( who teamed with van damme in the superior , but still lame - brained double team ) is at the helm , and he would rather attempt to dazzle us with fantastic camera angles than engage us with the plot . i suppose i enjoyed some of the camera work , but the incessant desperation of it all made me rather nauseous . the picture freezes in the middle of an action sequence , speeds are altered consistently , and the camera tricks mostly apply to traveling up gun barrels as the weapons are fired . it all sounds very cool . trust me , it isn ' t . as much as it scars me to say this ( har , har ) , van damme is terrible . sure , he does lots of fancy kickboxing moves and dodges giant crates with the greatest of ease . he looks like he ' s doing a bad impersonation of jackie chan , and his performance is stiff and tired . i hate to say it , but perhaps it ' s time for mr . van damme to give up his day job . it ' s really a test of endurance watching knock off . i suppose there ' s some enjoyment derived from schneider ' s character , who is extremely annoying , but provides the film ' s better moments . and what is the beautiful lela rochon doing in this movie ? hopefully she grabbed her paycheck and then fled the premises like an olympic sprinter . knock off doesn ' t even stand strong as a mindless but entertaining action film , like a handful of van damme ' s others . no , this movie is an embarrassment to the entire action genre of modern filmmaking . and considering how low hollywood has stooped as of late in that department , that is certainly not saying much . note to self : avoid universal soldier 2 : the return upon release in august ? 99 .\",\n",

       " ('as i walked out of crouching tiger , hidden dragon i thought to myself that i had had just seen a great film . with the passage of a few hours i tempered my enthusiasm and started pondering the question of whether a masterpiece must implicitly be a \" great \" piece of work and viceversa . attempting to make a distinction may be a matter of splitting hairs . i avoided a commitment by appealing to etymology . as the word implies , a masterpiece is any work which embodies the skills of a master . as such it should suffice to say that it is a product of exceptional quality . crouching tiger , hidden dragon fits comfortably in that category . crouching tiger , hidden dragon immerses the viewer in an idealized world of oriental folklore , with the requisite blend of legend , fantasy , magic and mythology . it is reminiscent of a wagnerian epic with characters which might as well be half - gods - greater than life , purer than life , stronger than life , physically invincible and able to accomplish superhuman feats , but with a human soul that makes them ultimately vulnerable . all the classic elements of the oriental mystique are thrown into the mix , including the art of contemplation and the concept of martial dexterity as the physical equivalent of spiritual advancement . the classic struggle between good and evil is the inevitable backdrop , with advanced masters of each and a golden pupil , which must choose between the two . it is the gifted pupil who , under the influence of the evil master steals the holy grail in the form of a magic sword which is the focus of the conflict at the heart of the legend . the elements of romance at two different levels of enlightenment ( a pair of masters and a pair of youngsters ) are poignantly represented . the paradox of oriental restraint existing side by side with all consuming passion in the same breast is projected effectively . the fight scenes are stunning balletic tours - de - force , not to be taken literally but clearly to be enjoyed as superb cinematic art , as are the prodigious leaps and flights to , from and between rooftops , the martial combat at the top of swaying bamboo branches and the combatants skipping like pebbles along the surface of a lake . there need be no question of suspended disbelief when one is in the presence of poetry . as in a wagnerian opera there is a substantial story line , which takes place at an ordinary human level , yet the entire project is to be accepted as a work of art rooted in fantasy . do not assume , however , that the art is limp - wristed . for those who are put off by the \" art \" label this film can be confidently recommended as engrossing entertainment at the levels of adventure , action and romance . there are no weak performances in this movie . michelle yeoh imbues her character with depth , humanity and wisdom . chow yon fat projects dignity and purity of heart . zhang ziyi is a budding superstar . she is radiantly beautiful and totally persuasive in a multifaceted role . cheng pei pei as the evil master and chang cheng as the bandit prince acquit themselves admirably . kudos to screenwriters james schamus , wang hui ling and tsai kuo jing , choreographer yuen wo - ping , photography director peter pau and music director tan dun , each of which contribute quality components to this extraordinary film . ang lee as the director , co - producer and mastermind of the project gets the lion share of the credit . this is destined to be one of those films that everybody likes , including those who hate martial arts movies . don \\' t miss it .',\n",

( blade dismisses a man - portable arc lamp as being too heavy , although it looks to be a more efficient tool to dispatch vampires . ) unfortunately , the guiding hand of john woo is absent from this film , relegating blade to the status of the replacement killers , which it most strongly resembles . the replacement killers is the last movie i saw that i didn ' t review -- mostly because it made no impression on me , and i couldn ' t remember anything other than noise , violence , and the intensity of fat ' s performance . blade has a little more going for it , and has the vampire myth to draw from -- but other than that , it ' s the same kind of movie -- exciting , with well choreographed action scenes , but with no resonance . with a stronger villain ( stephen dorff is ( pardon the pun ) curiously bloodless as the head vampire , leaving us to wonder what denis leary might have done with the role ) , a wittier script , and a strong supporting cast , blade might have been able to rise beyond the level of commonplace summer entertainment . as it is , blade is an average action movie that serves to do nothing but remind us that the summer movies just keep getting dumber and the vampire movies just keep multiplying .\",\n",

its constant equation of sex and violence , much of which is played with the intention of being erotic , is quite unsettling . it \\' s no surprise that the movie , like the book , fades to black with a dead woman on the floor . \" i , the jury \" had a troubled production and was not well - supported by the studio that made it , which is one explanation why it didn \\' t do well in theaters and many people have forgotten that it was ever made . the script was written by larry cohen , who is best known for his creatively cheesy but nonetheless effective monster movies , like \" it \\' s alive \" ( 1974 ) and its two sequels , \" q \" ( 1981 ) , and \" the stuff \" ( 1985 ) . cohen wrote the script thinking he was going to helm the project as well , but he was yanked from the director \\' s chair after only a week \\' s worth of shooting because he was already $ 100 , 000 over budget . he was quickly replaced by richard t . heffron , who has worked for the last three decades on a handful of undistinguished movies and dozens of television projects . heffron was obviously brought in not for his talent , but because he could make the movie rapidly and efficiently . it shows in the final product . cohen had personal interest in the updated version of hammer , but heffron has none . he shot the movie quickly and clumsily , and although some scenes ring true , most of them are flat , trite , and invariably dull . the movie features numerous car chases , shoot - outs , and stunts , but heffron \\' s background in television is the dominant tone ; despite the graphic violence and full - frontal nudity , \" i , the jury , \" takes on the air of a made - for - tv quickie , with no real punch or depth . but the problems in \" i , the jury \" run deeper than the technical . the central fault in this updating is mike hammer , whose character was lost in the shuffle while updating from the fifties to the eighties . because spillane wrote all his hammer mysteries in the first person , hammer \\' s character is central to the tale because all the events are filtered through his persona . we never really get that impression in the movie -- there is no first - person voice - over narration and some scenes don \\' t have hammer in them at all . consequently , a great deal of the texture of spillane \\' s storytelling is lost . the period updating turns out to be a detrimentally bad idea because much of hammer \\' s moral code is thrown to the wind . despite his characterization as a hard - nosed , violent , misogynistic killer , hammer always stuck fervently to his own moral code . the title itself , \" i , the jury , \" refers to his anti - establishment notion of being his own law . unlike private eyes who seek out the bad guys and then turn them over the police , hammer both pursues the criminal and exacts the punishment . in this way , he can be seen as \" above the law , \" but he still adheres strictly to her own personal code of conduct , his own morality . the movie forgoes that aspect of his character , and hammer comes off not only as amoral in society \\' s terms , but in any terms , especially his own . if anything , hammer always had his professionalism , but the movie does away with that in the first three minutes by showing him rolling in the sack with the wife of a client who had paid him to find out if that wife was being unfaithful . maybe the scene was intended for laughs , but it only cheapens hammer \\' s character and is , by all accounts , a lousy way to start the movie . the blame for hammer \\' s character can \\' t be laid on assante \\' s shoulders , because despite some unnecessary marlon brandon - like mumbling , he delivers a fine performance . spillane never once described hammer \\' s physical attributes in any of the dozen books in which he appeared , so any actor could conceivably portray him . of course , because of the lack of written description , those who have read spillane \\' s books will have a strong personal notion of what hammer looks like , and therefore almost any screen incarnation will somehow fall short of expectations ( spillane , who played the character himself in 1963 \\' s \" the girl hunters , \" is generally considered the best of the film hammers ) . the rest of actors are most un - noteworthy . with the exceptions of alan king and paul sorvino , everyone who appeared in \" i , the jury \" were up - and - comers who basically went nowhere . many of them ended up working in television ( like carrera , who had a short stint on \" dallas \" in the mid - eighties ) , which only adds to the made - for - tv atmosphere of the film . maybe someday , someone will manage to get the right elements together and make an effective film rendition of a spillane book , but this is certainly not it .',\n",

( perhaps i ' m just annoyed that the release of ` the peacemaker ' in the us overshadowed a far superior thriller , ` the assignment ' . ) it is very obvious that the title not only represents the big boom that will result from the collision , but also connotes the heavy impact on human lives . however , the film simply fails on that note . the effects are worn - out , the substandard screenplay limited the acting , and the director continued her sad run in terms of good - film - making credentials . she ' s still making good money though . t ? a leoni ' s unfortunate character , the news reporter , is the foundation of the story and of the cast . but the film suffers from too many characters that do not need to be explored . robert duvall ' s aging astronaut is lifeless , and morgan freeman ' s president is restricted to , well , a righteous president ( which means he ' s not interesting at all ) . leoni ' s character is the only appealing one , and is played with reasonable conviction ( but a rather peculiar showing when reporting for msnbc ) , but was definitely undervalued by the director and screenwriters . warning : spoilers included ( but a lot of it is irrelevant and predictable anyway ) . plot holes , plot holes , plot holes . now , e . l . e . is threatening to exterminate more than 99 % of the human race , and they send eight puny little nuclear bombs up there ? where ' s the logic ? leder could have at least made it plausible with 20 . and then it turns out that only a few percent of the world population actually perish , and those less selfish ones ( the ones that stayed at home ) were the victims . the film was almost mocking them , telling them they had died for nothing . i also fail to see how two teenagers , carrying a baby , would be the first to climb up the mountain / hill , even with a motorbike for a head - start . it ' s unlikely that the dust will take just two years to settle , but that doesn ' t really matter . building caves was a strategy mentioned in ` dr . strangelove ' , which proposed that people lived underground for one hundred or so years . now that is a more practical use for caves . what is the point of living in caves ? there is no , unlike ` dr . strangelove ' , any radioactivity outside to restrict exposure . how do plants grow ? if humans have the technology to keep plants alive in caves , there ' s no reason why they can ' t do it in the open . the president disclosed that other countries have been preparing their own caves . obviously this means that the other countries were informed a long time ago , and you can ' t be serious to say that nobody leaked the news to the media . in an important mission like that of the ` messiah ' , for that matter any mission , it is impossible that isn ' t sufficient fuel for an extra couple of hundred metres , needless to say tens of kilometres . this is not deep impact ? it ' s a frivolous cheap impact . but even with all that , some overacting , and a 3 . 4 rating , it ' s still watchable , just don ' t think about it . okay ?\",\n",

probably not , since it \\' s easy to guess , but i \\' ll go ahead and oblige anyone who wants a synopsis . the film opens by introducing us to a gang of bad guys on board a mercenary ship . in addition to the usual cast of psychopaths and lunatics , there \\' s finnegan ( treat williams ) , the boat \\' s pilot , who \\' s supposed to be an indiana jones knockoff ; joey ( kevin j . o \\' connor ) , the inept sidekick who \\' s supposed to be lovable and funny ( but is really just irritating ) ; and hanover ( wes studi ) , the \" mastermind \" ( and i use that term lightly ) of the operation . their goal : attack a cruise ship , clean out the safe , then sink it using some illegally - acquired torpedoes . the problem is , by the time they reach the argonautica , the titanic - like luxury liner has turned into the marie celeste . aside from a beautiful jewel thief ( famke janssen ) and a couple of crew members , there \\' s no one on board . the reason soon becomes obvious -- the ship has been taken over by a bad special effect that is supposed to resemble an octopus with teeth and more than eight tentacles . the cast , which is led by treat williams , is primarily comprised of has - beens and probably - never - will - bes ( two exceptions : wes studi , best known as the villain in the last of the mohicans , and djimon hounsou , amistad \\' s cinque ) . williams , once a \" can \\' t miss \" prospect in hollywood , has fallen so far out of favor that the best he can do these days for a lead role is a film like deep rising , and his inability to create a charismatic or interesting figure here may sink whatever is left of his sputtering career . famke janssen , who will forever be known as xenia onatopp from goldeneye , is the perfect bland match for williams . given her limited acting abilities , it \\' s likely that she was chosen for this part primarily on the basis of her physical attributes . unfortunately , a bra defeats the purpose of having her in a wet tee - shirt for half of the picture . meanwhile , kevin j . o \\' connor , who has entirely too much screen time , exhibits all the appeal of fingernails scratching a blackboard . these days , audiences are becoming more difficult to impress with computer - generated special effects . this is a lesson that writer / director stephen sommers ( who previously helmed the live - action jungle book ) needs to learn . the days of jurassic park , when viewers were astounded by the mere spectacle of seeing something big and imposing on screen , are past . now , movie - goers are looking for the sophistication of titanic -- visuals that are so well - incorporated that it \\' s impossible to tell where they end and where \" reality \" begins . in deep rising , the monster , like everything , is artificial and unconvincing . unfortunately , the fundamental problem audiences are faced with here isn \\' t so much the idiotic monotony of this individual picture , but the poor quality of the entire bankrupt genre ( although , to be fair , deep rising is a particularly bad entry ) . even once this film has sunk out of sight , the knowledgeable viewer knows it won \\' t be the last of its kind . like the slimy , slithering things that inhabit the air vents and pipes of these movies , more are waiting just around the corner in ambush . and that consideration , unlike anything on screen , is truly horrifying .',\n",

( in fact , the movie was originally a short film entitled x expanded to feature length . ) the early april release date is too mistimed to capitalize on the movie ' s christmas setting , and the los angeles / las vegas nightlife is something too far from the mainstream for most theater - goers to attach themselves to . the characters are shallow to the point of prerequisite , and performances from little - known players like polley , askew , and taye diggs don ' t help or hurt the roles . in fact , even bigger names like mohr , wolf , and katie holmes don ' t have enough time to make substantial success . although that ' s almost expected for lack of continuous screen time , the success in the picture should come from a thread that binds the stories . go doesn ' t have this , and it suffers because of it . as far as teen movies are concerned , go represents the absolute bottom , for its constant stream of indecipherable light and sound mean nothing without some sort of common theme . ( the following do not count as common themes : drug deals , people attempting to have romantic interludes with drug dealers , people resorting to drug deals for alterior motives , or people not involved in drug deals stumbling into them . ) at times , the humor in go is sickly funny , and on a low night , almost watchable ; but for the majority of its running time and for most viewers , this movie will best be left to teens at blockbuster on a saturday night .\",\n",

       " ('the opening crawl tells us that the galaxy is in turmoil over the taxation of trade routes , and the greedy trade federation has used it \\' s armada of powerful space battleships to blockade the planet naboo . we soon find that the federation plans to invade the planet with an enormous army of warrior robots and force naboo \\' s ruler , the young queen amidala ( natalie portman ) to sign a treaty giving the federation control . however , the galactic republic has sent jedi knights qui - gon jinn ( liam neeson ) and obi - wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) as emissaries to the federation in order to negotiate for the ending of the blockade . no sooner do they arrive than the federation leaders are instructed via holographic transmission by a mysterious cloaked figure to destroy the jedi , and the first battle begins . it seems that for me and thousands of people like me , the love for george lucas \\' s trilogy of star wars movies has only grown over time . we \\' re the fans , not the freaks . we won \\' t go dressing up like darth vader ( although you have to admit those imperial uniforms are pretty darn cool ) , and we won \\' t incorporate lines from the script in our everyday conversations ( not all the time , anyway ) , but if someone wants to challenge us to a little trivia contest , we \\' re throwing down . all right , stop looking at me like that . we have been faithfully and patiently waiting . waiting for this movie ever since the end credits of return of the jedi started to roll . you see , the trilogy is not just a set of movies , but a religion of sorts to we , the faithful disciples , and the phantom menace is tantamount to the second coming of the messiah . unfortunately , it is not our savior . for weeks beforehand , i was going around telling people that this movie had better be damned good - stupendously good - miraculously good . anything less and it \\' ll be the biggest disappointment of the century . i didn \\' t want the doomsaying prophecy to come true , really i didn \\' t , but this film nevertheless fails to reach the pinnacles of filmmaking . character development is virtually nonexistent . with the possible exception of qui - gon , most of the film \\' s characters seem left with nothing to do but go through the motions . none seem very affected by their experiences , and few even show any passion at all . contrast this with the horribly irritating comic relief we are nearly continuously subjected to in the form of jar jar binks , a creature belonging to a race which lives in underwater cities on naboo , in precarious symbiosis with the land dwellers led by amidala . jar jar \\' s life is saved by qui - gon early in the film , and travels with our heroes for the sole reason of making us laugh ( or supposedly so ) . his speech mannerisms are so \" cute - ified \" that i couldn \\' t understand a third of what he was saying , and the slapstick he performed was just distracting . his head gets caught in an electronic field , his foot gets caught in the stirrup of some large beast , he describes being in trouble as \" deep doo doo , \" and even manages to step in some of the same while walking around in mos eisley spaceport . therein lies a key difference between this film and one of its predecessors . in star wars , we had obi - wan telling us mos eisley was a \" wretched hive of scum and villainy . \" in the phantom menace , we get doo doo . the films of the trilogy took me away from my everyday life and immersed me in a story \" a long time ago in a galaxy far , far away . . . . \" this film , on the other hand , constantly reminds me that it \\' s only a movie by including situations and phrases that are so uniquely modern american that they seem incredibly out of place and serve to jerk the viewer from the experience . perhaps the most blatant offense occurs during a scene where young anakin skywalker enters into a pod racing competition ( it \\' s kind of like chariot racing with large engines instead of horses ) , and there are a couple of commentators in a press box delivering indy 500 - like play by play . i liked the pod race ; it was really exciting and ratcheted the tension , but when the heck did lucas think up the idea of putting in the sportscasters ? the race would have been even more exciting without the distraction . this aspect , coupled with the emphasis on humor simply baffled me . i suppose one may say that lucas was trying to appeal to the younger viewer , but would more intelligent scenes and dialog hurt this appeal at all ? didn \\' t millions of youngsters still go back to see the original star wars in 1977 over and over again ? didn \\' t the action figures still sell like hotcakes ? of course they did , and it \\' s only poor judgment that allows the most - eagerly awaited film in history to be marred by pandering to children who would still have enjoyed a film with more appeal for adults . one aspect that will appeal broadly , however , is the use of special effects . the people at lucas \\' s industrial light and magic , the world \\' s premiere effects house , outdid themselves in providing seamless integration of computer - generated images and real - life footage . some of the scenes have to be seen to be believed , especially the shots of a land battle between the federation \\' s robot army and jar jar \\' s countrymen . the space battles are also impressive , although improved over past efforts by only subtle margins to the casual observer . this , however , is a testament to the work which ilm produced two decades ago and still holds up well today . john williams is back , of course , providing a score for the film as only he can . his music is pervasive throughout , as rousing and as dramatic as ever , always serving to punctuate scenes noticeably and appropriately . since this film is supposed to be the first installment in a nine - episode story ( star wars , the empire strikes back and return of the jedi being episodes four , five and six , respectively ) , the phantom menace has the daunting task of setting up the origins of several characters we know already , in addition to those with whom we unfamiliar . as a result , attention to history and characterization was spread a little thin . it would have been nice to get more in depth with yoda and obi - wan , for example , but given the fact that there were several new characters to cover , it is understandable that some of the development has been left for the next two films . one of the new characters is darth maul , hailed as the new villain with as much hype as marketing forces could muster prior to this film \\' s release . in spite of the hype , darth maul is a character which almost didn \\' t have to be in the film , his role is so insignificant . he has maybe three spoken lines ( believe it or not , a second actor voices the character ) and the rest of the time just scowls and looks mean . with that working against him , he never has a chance at being interesting and instead ends up an utter disappointment . lucas seems to have wanted to develop the spiritual nature of the star wars universe , something which has been prominent throughout . however , he does so largely by paralleling the star wars spirituality with the bible , offering an easy out for story - writing and once again bringing the viewer back to planet earth with a real - life connection . oddly , while trying to capitalize on spirituality , lucas at the same time introduces the fact that mastery of the force is dependent upon having little force - loving parasites in your body \\' s cells . this only serves to de - mystify the workings of the force a few notches by offering a scientific connection . don \\' t let me mislead you too far . the phantom menace , by most standards , is a good film . it contains a lot of visual treats , sets the stage for an epic story , gives us a bit of excitement here and there , and even allows us to revisit some of our old friends . it \\' s just that when held up to it \\' s predecessors ( and to not do so would be unrealistic ) , this film simply pales .',\n",

       " ('in chocolat , a chocolate shop owner tells her customers to look into a spinning object of obscure textures , patterns , and lines , hoping she \\' ll be able to foresee the kind of chocolate they \\' ll most enjoy . some scoff the idea , but everyone who gazes into the complexity of the spinning object winds up seeing something different than the next , revealing personality traits which the person may not have known they had before . this can easily stand as a model for chocolat as a whole : on the surface , it appears to be a light , fluffy fable with no depth or true worth , but when one takes a second , deeper look , chocolat \\' s true colors begin to shine through . making a bold statement about organized religion and those who practice it , lasse hallstrom \\' s chocolat is flawlessly acted and meticulously crafted - not to mention one of the best films of the year . what gives chocolat its magic , much like hallstrom \\' s 1999 winner of two academy awards , the cider house rules , is its willingness to say what \\' s on its mind without holding back to prevent offending audiences . the bold and honest message hallstrom conveys with chocolat will no doubt outrage a select group of viewers , but those who are willing to suspend their bitterness because they feel they are being intimidated or attacked should find themselves to be in agreement with what the film says about narrow - mindedness . chocolat centers its story around the small french village of lansquenet , where majority rules , and the majority lives by only one law : religion . the bulk of the townspeople ( with few exceptions ) are preparing for the sacred time of abstinence , lent , but when the independent thinking , seemingly non - religious vianne rocher ( juliette binoche ) and her daughter anouk ( victoire thivisol ) make the village their home , the people will be tempted beyond belief by the mouth - watering confections in the chocolate shop vianne opens . many are predictably opposed and deeply offended by vianne \\' s opening of the chocolate shop just in time for lent , especially the mayor , comte de reynaud ( a cartoon - like alfred molina ) , who will stop at nothing to put her out of business . on the other hand , the shop is a delight to others , including the cranky armande voizin ( judi dench ) , who sits day by day in vianne \\' s shop , telling the single mother about her unfortunate detached relationship with her grandson ( aurelien parent - koening ) , which comes as a result of his mother ( carrie - ann moss ) believing armande is a bad influence , as she does not hold the same , strict religious beliefs that she does . also a fan of the chocolate is the nervous wreck josephine muscat , whose husband is constantly beating her , to whom vianne offers a home and befriends . juliette binoche is charming and honest as vianne , genuinely capturing her character \\' s determination to turn the narrow - minded townspeople into more happy , independent human beings , but most of chocolat \\' s success is unquestionably a result of the remarkable performances of the supporting actresses . lena olin , previously nominated for an oscar in 1989 , deserves her second nomination for her earnest , moving portrayal of a lost , scared woman torn between staying true to her battering , manipulative husband or leaving him to live the life which for which she longs . judi dench is sharp , incisive , and occasionally greatly touching as armande voizin . carrie ann - moss , in what is likely to be her first largely noticed ( and acclaimed ) role since the matrix , shows a more solid side of her acting skills not previously seen , crafting a character that the viewer both sympathizes with and despises simultaneously . victoire thivisol shows much promise as anouk , a young girl hoping her always - on - the - move mother will eventually settle down . a trade ad for chocolat sums up best the power the actresses have on screen with the tagline : \" five extraordinary women , one extraordinary movie . \" that \\' s not to say the men don \\' t do their share , though : alfred molina makes for a sly and utterly repugnant antagonist , hugh o \\' conor adds quite a bit of comic relief as the priest who seems to not even know why he is who he is , and johnny depp gives a strong performance as the pirate roux , who enters the film late in the game and sparks the romantic interest of vianne . the technical aspects of chocolat are strong across the board : lasse hallstrom directs his enchanting fable with great care , perfectly balancing the elements of each genre to be found within the film . cinematographer roger pratt brings an atmospheric , fairy tale look to the film , and rachel portman \\' s masterful score is her best and most memorable since the cider house rules . chocolat , adapted by robert nelson jacobs from the joanne harris novel , is a wonderful little treat of a film , one that will most likely win over the hearts of audiences and the votes of academy members this winter , and the aggressive backing of miramax films assures the latter . while not as powerful as the cider house rules , lasse hallstrom \\' s chocolat is a film which works on all levels - as a drama , a comedy , a fable , a romance , and a fairy tale . and it even lives up to its name : it is delicious to savor the taste of , easy to digest , and , like all excellent chocolate , it is memorable for days afterward . the bottom line : chocolat is pure pleasure .',\n",

ups , nor does he put a lid on the metaphysical confusion : the cinematic demons of \" lost highway \" are out in full force from beginning to end . this description might make \" lost highway \" sound like a giddy exercise in haywire surrealism , but in fact , while there are traces of lynch \\' s weird sense of humor , this film is anything but giddy most of the time . on the contrary , lost highway is a dark and perplexing mystery that takes lynch \\' s previous excursions into murder and intrigue one step farther . the film does not revolve around a character investigating a mystery ; rather , the character * is * the mystery . there are recurring and at times deeply disturbing images of suspicion , distrust , and infidelity thoughout the film that seem to indicate a deluded , fractured psyche at the root of all the bizarre goings - on here . we , the audience , are left to puzzle out whose psyche it is that is driving this ( probably fred \\' s , in my opinion ) and what , in that case , the other characters and events are meant to represent . all of this proceeds , appropriately , in lynch \\' s typically slow - paced , idiosyncratic style . as is often the case , lynch relies on sound , imagery , and mood more than on dialogue and action to tell his story , and in \" lost highway \" it works perfectly . there are scenes when the camera lingers on fred \\' s blank expression as he drifts uncomfortably down a hallway , or on his pained face in his prison cell while the haunting strains of this mortal coil \\' s \" song to the siren \" can be heard faintly in the background ; nothing is technically \" happening \" in these scenes , yet they present a vivid picture of a man losing his grip just as effective as , if not more so than , the hysterical screaming found in most movie presentations of insanity . lynch \\' s direction and director of photography pete deming \\' s darkly lit cinematography serve to create a nearly suffocating atmosphere of tension and fear that are exactly what is needed for this story . well , most of the time , anyway - i have to admit that i was a bit bored at times during the section of the film with pete dayton as the protgaonist , which is less inherently interesting and mostly keeps the viewer \\' s attention because of its tie - ins to the original mystery . the main characters in this \" reality \" - dayton ( a well - meaning but none too intelligent 24 - year - old ) , a sleazy gangster ( who for some reason has two names but otherwise is pretty much a stock character ) , and his porn - star girlfriend ( the blond arquette ) - are nothing you couldn \\' t find in any of the two dozen \" pulp fiction \" wannabes ; fortunately , the reappearance of the mystery man as well as some other typically lynchian elements , such as the strained , awkward conversations between pete and his parents , help to preserve the film \\' s spooky , unnerving tone during this stretch . lynch \\' s typically graphic and disturbing portrayals of fringe sexuality , while relevant to the themes of jealousy and adultery , are also somewhat overdone here . it \\' s not exactly exploitative - like almost everything else in this film , the sex is thoroughly weird and creepy and is unlikely to provide any cheap lurid thrills - as much as it is unnecessary and frankly kind of dumb by the seventh or eighth time arquette takes her clothes off . that said , these minor flaws don \\' t prevent \" lost highway \" from attaining its place as one of the darkest , most unsettling films to hit the screens in recent years . it is a one - way ride down the lost highway of a disturbed mind , and as such it is gripping , intense , and brilliantly effective .',\n",

it still remains serious , and it does not overdo itself . oh , and there were plenty of explosions in \" metro , \" as well . how nice it was of the filmmakers to give us those . if there is one major objection i had to \" metro \" , it was the length , an area where a lot of action films seem to wear out their welcomes . \" metro \" is a film that lasted a little too long , but it was still entertaining , and it gave me something to do while i waited for it to end . paul haynes \" >',\n",

( his initial conversations with hopkins sound shockingly like hannibal lecter . . . ) and the ultimate resolution to one of the film \\' s supernatural problems seems , well , somewhat superficial . still , even with the film \\' s length , it was a pleasant time at the movies , something you wouldn \\' t necessarily expect from a film about death . . . but one which meet joe black delivers anyhow .',\n",

s : we - lei becomes absorbed in his career , indulges in an affair with a co - worker ; jia - li feels restless and trapped , bound by a choice she made while young , but which no longer seems wise . the film never redeems these clich ? s by conveying the feel of authentic experience , the intensity of lived pain , and much of it seems trite and belaboured . it unfolds , awkwardly , as a series of flashbacks , told during a luncheon in vienna , where jia - li meets her brother \\' s old flame ( teresa hu ) , now a concert pianist , whom she has not seen since college . both women seem rather sad , and resigned to their sadness . their circumstances ( and those of jia - li \\' s brother and a college friend ) suggest not so much that they have made the wrong choices -- married the wrong man , chosen the wrong career path , etc . -- but rather that the choices available to them were inadequate . it is not that jia - li married the wrong man ; she didn \\' t . the problem is that she needed to marry at all -- and that if she did not marry , she would still be just as unhappy . for a woman in modern taiwan , that day tells us , the cards are stacked , the dice are loaded : she can play the game , but the house always wins . the film \\' s sympathetic feminist implications are presumably the reason it caused such controversy upon its release in taiwan . seen now , it does not seem provocative . indeed , it \\' s hard to imagine anyone having felt passionate enough about the film to generate any controversy : it may be ambitious , it may be innovative , but it is also terribly , terribly dull . and what was new for taiwan was not necessarily new for the rest of us : yang adopts methods established years before by antonioni and others , and his use of those methods is fumbling , uncertain , undisciplined . nor does he bring anything new -- other than the locale -- to the material . there are moments when that day takes on some of the emotional richness it strives for -- in a young couple \\' s first kiss , in the awkward meeting of a woman and her husband \\' s mistress -- but they are brief . too often , yang devotes needless time to mundane scenes -- grocery shopping , flower - arranging -- in which nothing happens , little is said , no emotion imparted . perhaps , if the film were content to focus on such reflective , inward moments , leaving us to guess at thoughts and feelings , it might have been ambiguous , suggestive , insinuating . but jia - li and her disaffected companions do not only brood in silence : they talk about their problems , at length , in detail , redundantly , and eliminate all subtleties . at two hours and forty - five minutes , it all seems exorbitantly long , indulgently long - winded . consider the defining moment for jia - li , the titular day on the beach . the thrust of the whole film explains , easily enough , what we are to think of that moment , what it means when she walks away from a particular situation . even so , the film has not one but two characters explain it for us verbally , in case we may have missed the point . needless time is devoted to expressing what should have remained unexpressed , and that is the problem throughout . the look of the film is as tedious as the drawn - out narrative . it was the first feature shot by christopher doyle -- at least , it \\' s his name in the credits -- who is now rightly regarded as one of the world \\' s leading cinematographers . in the freewheeling expressionism of his work with directors like chen kaige and wong kar - wai , he seems incapable of fashioning a boring image . you would never know it from watching that day , which , due either to doyle \\' s inexperience or yang \\' s humdrum direction , is almost perverse in its insistence on making the physical environment seem as drab and banal as possible . in scrutinizing the long decay of a marriage , that day manages to capture the ennui of the experience , but none of the damage , none of the heartbreak .',\n",

yu ( miguel ferrer ) . soon , china \\' s emperor ( pat morita ) mobilizes his armies and decrees that one male from each family in the country shall serve to fight in china \\' s defense . when the fa family is served notice , it is the elderly father , fa zhou ( soon - tek oh ) who must answer the call , as there are no other males in the household . fearing her father will surely be killed in battle , fa mulan ( ming - na wen ) disguises herself as a man and sneaks off with the royal orders to join the chinese army . mulan , based on a chinese epic poem , is a classic tale of the triumph of the ugly duckling . mulan herself is a disgrace to her loving family , as she has a difficult time fitting into the traditional woman \\' s role , and in a very amusing scene where a matchmaker attempts to assess her value to a potential husband , we see that \" grace \" is not one of her strong points . very early on , we are presented with the high importance of bringing honor to one \\' s family , and by botching her chance at gaining the favor of the matchmaker , mulan fails at that task . by leaving home to fight in her father \\' s place , she may not only spare his life , but bring honor , too . as is the case with most disney musicals , the songs are first rate and pervasive throughout the film . i \\' m not sure if they will get much airplay , but at least one of the songs will no doubt receive recognition come oscar time . both lea salonga , who provides the singing voice for mulan , and donny osmond who sings for shang , the captain of mulan \\' s army unit and obligatory love interest , are more than competent , although salonga \\' s voice translates much better to animation . you have to hear it to understand . interestingly , the musical numbers which are so often done with big flourishes are surprisingly muted in mulan . there is no significantly big number , which is customary as the second or third song in a disney film , but this does not detract significantly from the rest of the movie . it is , however , an expectation which has been built by disney \\' s own formulaic history , and some viewers may feel as if something is missing . artistically , the animators have chosen to adopt the more subdued pastels of chinese artwork , and although this may not live up to the vibrance so associated with many of the other disney works , it helps to contribute a more authentic , and therefore more credible , nature to what otherwise may be seen as a typically \" disneyfied \" ethnic tale . there are also a couple of visually standout scenes , one involving the charge of shan - yu \\' s hun army , which utilizes the same computer - enhanced imagery disney animators have employed since the chandelier in beauty and the beast . the other scene worth mentioning is so quick you might miss it . when mulan resolves to take her father \\' s place , she dons her father \\' s old battle armor , and unsheathes a sword . as she does so , you can see her reflection in the polished metal . it just left me thinking , \" that was really cool . \" a wonderful range of performances delight the audience throughout the film , varying from the straight , such as soon - tek oh as fa zhou , to the comical , such as harvey fierstein as yao , a gruff , pugilistic member of shang \\' s conscripted army . even more outrageous is eddie murphy as mushu , the diminutive guardian dragon sent to look after mulan . although an obvious attempt to relive the chemistry brought forth by robin williams in aladdin , murphy nevertheless distinguishes himself with his own winning performance . i found the choice of b . d . wong as shang a little strange ( you may remember him as martin short \\' s wedding planner assistant in the father of the bride ) , but they used robbie benson for the voice of the beast in beauty and the beast , so i guess anything \\' s possible . in any event , wong performs admirably as well . one character which provides a significant amount of humor is grandmother fa . she deserves recognition not only because of the levity she brings to the movie , but also because she is voiced by two very remarkable people . june foray , who supplies grandmother fa \\' s speaking voice , is a venerable voice actress who may be best known for her work as rocky the squirrel and natasha fatale ( as in boris and natasha ) . marni nixon , who provides grandmother fa \\' s singing voice , is the same vocalist who dubbed the voices for anna in the king and i , maria in west side story , and eliza in my fair lady . with this in mind , hearing grandmother fa is like listening to a little piece of history . mulan is the latest disney animated feature to get away from some of the eurocentrism which for so long dominated disney films . in an effort to be culturally sensitive ( and to avoid a \" miss saigon \" - type debacle ) , disney has also wisely chosen to employ many asian - american actors for both lead and supporting roles . in addition to the actors already mentioned , the cast includes such ubiquitous talents as james hong , gedde watanabe , james shigeta , and george takei . i guess clyde kusatsu wasn \\' t available . at a running time of slightly under an hour and a half , mulan moves quickly and provides solid entertainment for both children and , happily , adults . this is the kind of disney feature that makes you wonder what they will do next , rather than hope that the next one is better .',\n",

       " ('capsule : silly and inane adaptation of gibson \\' s short story , which is nowhere in sight . gibson \\' s script only adds insult to injury . johnny mnemonic is an awesomely bad movie . i say \" awesomely \" because it \\' s one thing to fail , but another thing entirely to fail so completely that even the chances for camp value are sabotaged . keanur reeves ( who is terrible ) stars as johnny , an \" information courier \" who can carry dozens of gigabytes of data in his head . he is given \" one last job \" ( whenever you are in a movie and you hear those words , run ) , which involves him shoving so much data into his cranium that it could be lethal . one of the neater touches that the movie brings in is that the only way he could make such an arrangement work was by ditching all of his childhood memories , but it \\' s only followed up on in a token fashion . for his trouble , johnny gets chased by the yakuza , who seem to be the new bad guys in all the high - tech thrillers . what \\' s funny is that if you watch gangster movies made * in * japan , there are whole gobs of details about genuine yakuza behavior and ethics , but of course there \\' s no room in this movie for any of that . the yakuza are simply used to point guns , wave swords , flaunt tattoos , and grimace menacingly . ( i could go on about how gangsters and criminals of many other ethnicities have gotten thoughtful examinations in the movies -- bound by honor , sugar hill and american me come to mind -- when asians remain perpetually stereotyped . but that \\' s another essay . ) anyway , johnny runs and eventually winds up in newark . why newark ? maybe because it was cheaper to fake a future newark than a future new york , that \\' s why . there , he meets an assortment of odd characters ( ice - t , dolph lundgren and henry rollins play a whole gallery of weirdos ) . the script deals with them with all the depth of pieces of furniture . it turns out ( what else ? ) that the data in johnny \\' s head could save a lot of people , but of course johnny only wants it out of his head so it doesn \\' t kill him . handled right , this could have been absorbing , but the script manages to mangle any chance of real sympathy for johnny at every opportunity . the details about the look and feel of the future are all phoned in from other , better movies -- blade runner and brazil come to mind . everything looks run - down and scummy , everyone dresses like they \\' re punk rockers , and videophones are commonplace . snore . the only really interesting flourish is an extended depiction of the way the internet might work in the future ( complete with vr goggles and feedback gloves ) , but i kept thinking that it was more like what some relatively un - technical fellow would * think * it would look and behave like . a hacker of johnny \\' s caliber would be blasting away with one command - line function after another , instead of wasting all this time twiddling with holograms , but of course that \\' s not cinematic . whatever . what went wrong with this movie ? gibson wrote his own screenplay , which i guess is part of the problem : what works as a short story doesn \\' t work in a movie . his ear for dialogue is terrible and the plot doesn \\' t advance , it convulses . from the script on out , it was probably all downhill . renting the movie to make fun of it is sort of pointless ; there \\' s no fun in kicking a wounded dog , is there ?',\n",

should this guy be forced to do something he doesn \\' t want to do ? this appears to be one of the million questions in this film , which is jam - packed with greatness , but does not have the totally brilliant whole it should . i \\' m not saying \" good will hunting \" is a bad film at all . it \\' s a very enjoyable film with tons of great moments , and lots of great things about it . the acting is amazing , with two oscar - nomination - worthy performances from damon and williams , who have amazing chemistry together . we also get some great support from stellan skarsg ? rd ( great name ) , ben affleck , and from minnie driver , who plays will \\' s love interest , skylar . there are tons of individual moments that i adored . i loved all the comedy in the film , especially a scene where damon proves a schmuck out of a college student who is quoting a historian to impress some chicks , his various attempts at therapy , and of course , my favorite scene in the entire film , the one where he delivers a long , exstensive rant to some nsa agents about the downside of working for them . i liked the relationship between some of the people , like will and skylar , will and sean , sean and lambeau , and will and his friends . there are scenes between them which are just amazing to watch . and there are even moments in the film which are so honest in their portrayal , that i felt rightfully uncomfortable . like the break - up scene between will and skylar , will and sean \\' s first meeting , a bar scene between sean and lambeau , and a scene where sean tells in detail how he doesn \\' t regret meeting his first wife , who would later suffer a slow , painful death , and leave him lonely and slightly bitter . however , the main flaw of the film is there \\' s too much of everything , and not enough of it either . the film tries for deeper relations between the characters , but they \\' re sometimes either overwritten or underwritten . take for example the relationship between sean and will : the film gets an interesting father / son as well as doctor / patient relationship going with out any problems , but when it tries to show them as equals , it falls on its face . we hear how they went to the same town , and there are even scenes where the film shows how hypocritical both of them are at times . but this never takes off like the other parts of their relationship do . also , will \\' s relationship with his best friend , chuckie ( affleck ) , has a nice climax , but not enough rising action . we see them joking around , but when chuckie arrives at a decision between the two of them , it seems more like a superficial reasoning than a more selected one . their relationship never goes beyond \" just best friends , \" and his decision just seems to be a generalization of any two best friends instead of something more . . . human . maybe it was just me . and it also goes for a parallelism with the relationship between sean and lambeau , but that , again , is underwritten . and , of course , as in most films like this , the girl / boy relationship is pretty underwritten . we never understand what they see in each other , so when skylar confesses that she loves him , it seems more like it \\' s there for plot details that anything else . minnie driver is interesting , though , and breathes life into her character . the writing is a bit at fault here , but what makes all this worthwhile is the little moments in the film where it acheives true awesomeness . sure , it feels overstuffed , but it \\' s extremely enjoyable . the dialogue that affleck and damon have written is amazingly fresh , and seems extremely human . i think that they should get a nomination for their script chiefly because of the dialogue , which is amazing . while this is probably director gus van sant \\' s most conservative film ( you \\' d hardly know it \\' s the same director of \" to die for , \" the only van sant film i \\' ve seen , really ) , it \\' s still a pretty remarkable film , albeit a tad overrated ( what \\' s this \" best picture \" deal ? ) . and if a film puts a smile on my face despite posessing a lot of flaws , i have no problem with reccomending it to anyone .',\n",

       " ('vampire lore and legend has always been a popular fantasy element , substantiated by not only the sheer number of movies about the subject , but also the proliferation of cults and sects of adherents . and , unlike any of the more outlandish myths , the vampire holds some real - world probability ( one study claims 1 , 000 bloodsuckers exist worldwide , and places 50 in los angeles ) . but lest the nasties be mistaken for simple comic book bad guys , john carpenter would like to remind us that they are - and always have been - a truly frightening element of the thriller genre . and remind us he does in his latest film , vampires . there was some question , as halloween weekend approached , of how well vampires would do in comparison to new line cinema \\' s immensely successful blade , released in august . the two films take noticeably different stands on the vampire issue , and don \\' t even agree on some basic points of the slaying method . ( for instance , blade \\' s main weapons are silver and garlic , whereas main character jack crow \\' s technique is a wooden stake to the heart . ) blade also gives more of a face to the vampire civilization , while carpenter would like us to remain in the dark about how the pasties operate . both have their advantages , and here , carpenter \\' s style lends itself to a darker breed of suspense rather than the action movie that blade director stephen norrington delievered . when it \\' s all said and done , though , the vampires still kill and die with a bloody flourish ; the level for gore is indeed set to maximum . this time , our hero is vatican - sponsored slayer jack crow ( james woods ) . he \\' s a cynical , battle - worn veteran , and the best of his bunch . he and his team are responsible for cleaning out the american southwest , and after exterminating a nest one night , they run up against a super - vampire ( termed a \" master \" ) named valek ( thomas ian griffith ) . valek kills all of jack \\' s team except for his partner , tony montoya ( daniel baldwin ) , and as the two regroup , they learn that valek is the original vampire - now over six hundred years old . apparently , valek and his minions have been sweeping the southwest for decades in search of a cross that will enable them to walk in the daytime . so with the aid of a priest named adam ( tim guinee ) and a bitten hooker ( sheryl lee ) as bait , they track valek down for the final confrontation . the script for vampires , written by don jakoby and based on the john steakley novel , is perhaps the wittiest piece of screenplay to see production all year . crow , in particular , is a fun source of one - liners , and woods does every one of them with perfect stoicism . baldwin , lee , and guinee are all fine supports , adding to the character pool , but the other true highlight of the movie is thomas ian griffith \\' s bad guy . griffith \\' s intense expression is perfect for the role , and the only downside is that he \\' s got to talk sometime . luckily , he \\' s got few lines , and manages to pull off a rather thrilling performance . all said , fans will surely be impressed by this picture , and those who found apt pupil a bit limp will be excited by this one . certainly a worthwhile visit to the theaters .',\n",

       " ('robert altman \\' s cookie \\' s fortune is that rare movie that does not depend on sentimentality to be uplifting and to make its viewers feel good . it is a sunny , delightful , dreamy comedy , filled with lovely performances , skillful direction and topped off with an understated , clever , extraordinary script . as this is an ensemble piece , it is forced to start of slowly as it introduces us to its characters , all of them residing in a southern town called holly springs . first we meet willie ( charles s . dutton ) , an honest man with a slight drinking habit . we then see that willie takes care of an elderly lady nicknamed cookie , who is slowly losing her grip on sanity and is being filled with loneliness , despair , and want of her dead husband . we cut to camille ( glenn close ) who is obsessively directing a play with her sister cora ( julianne moore ) . then we briefly get acquainted with emma ( liv tyler ) , an apparent relative of cookie , who is a down - but - not - out teen outcast , still full of love and hope even though she has no real place to live . we also fleetingly see emma \\' s lover jason ( chris o \\' donnell ) , an ambitious but far too excitable young cop . we are now about one quarter through the two hour picture , and robert altman decides that it is time to set the plot in motion . we see the ecstatic cookie stare hopefully at a picture of her husband . she exclaims \" here i come ! \" and then puts a pillow to her face and shoots herself . soon after , her niece camille stops by to get a fruit salad bowl , comes upstairs , finds cookie dead and flips out . convinced that suicide is a disgrace and that she will have none of that in her family , she eats the suicide note and convinces her slightly slow ( yet sweet ) sister that it was a murder . she makes sure that she stages it like a murder as well ; scattering jewelry all over the floor , breaking a few cabinets , windows and doors , and then throwing the gun out in the back yard . the only reasonable suspect is willie , who immediately gets taken into custody , and put in a jail cell ( they all know he didn \\' t do it , so the cell stays open and he plays scrabble with the sheriff and the faithful emma ) . meanwhile , the unperturbed camille continues her none - too - subtle manipulations trying to further cover up for the murder while at the same time making her easter play a success . so begins cookie \\' s fortune , a film aptly described by critic scott renshaw as \" a southern spin on fargo , \" except that this one is far funnier and much more enjoyable than the coen brothers \\' darker , somewhat disturbing and slightly overrated escapade . robert altman \\' s slight picture is in some ways reminiscent of something like midnight in the garden of good and evil as well , in that both films focus ( on and off ) on the eccentricities of the residents in a southern us town . indeed , most of the characters in cookie \\' s fortune are loads of fun to observe , and a portion of them are fascinating and surprisingly multi - dimensional . glenn close turns in an insubstantial ( in terms of her career ) but magnificent performance as the conniving camille and is also the source of a good portion of the many laughs that we enjoy in this movie , and she is perfectly cast as the prolific \" aunt alexandria \" character , endlessly obsessed with family dignity . the equally essential role of willie is handled with an intangible grace by veteran thespian charles s . dutton ( mimic , a time to kill ) there is nothing like a movie which leaves you feeling all warm and fuzzy inside hours , even days after the film ends . cookie \\' s fortune is such a movie . i loved the light , kindhearted approach altman ( whose last project was the dark , intense drama the gingerbread man ) took towards the tricky subject matter . i enjoyed the talented ensemble cast . i even liked the trite \" in the south everybody is related to everybody \" cliche that is inevitably employed by the time this movie draws to a close . i \\' m not sure why cookie \\' s fortune had such an all - around pleasing effect on me . perhaps it \\' s that good ol \\' southern charm .',\n",

       " ('i want to correct what i wrote last year in my retrospective of david lean \\' s war picture . i still think that \" the bridge on the river kwai \" doesn \\' t deserve being the number 13 in the american film institute \\' s list of the 100 greatest american movies . and i think that \" 12 angry men \" , \" witness for the prosecution \" and \" paths of glory \" would have been better choices for the oscar for the best picture of 1957 . but i can \\' t deny the importance of \" the bridge on the river kwai \" - cinematically and in its contents . the film is set in burma in 1943 . a batallion of british soldiers in japanese war captivity is forced by the japanese to build a strategically momentous railway bridge over the river kwai . but the british commanding officer , colonel nicholson ( alec guinness ) , insists - corresponding to the geneva conventions - that his officers needn \\' t work as simple workmen . struggling toughly , col . nicholson forces the japanese commandant , col . saito ( sessue hayakawa ) , to give way in this respect . afterwards col . nicholson assiduously commits himself for the building of the bridge . he considers it an opportunity to raise his men \\' s morale , and he wants to prove superior british capabilities to the japanese . but the british high command sends a few soldiers who shall destroy the bridge , among them the american shears ( william holden ) - an escapee from the japanese prison camp - and the british major warden ( jack hawkins ) . . . a flaw of the picture is the clich ? d characterization of the japanese people . they are presented as if they were intellectually inferior to the british - as if the japanese were incapable of building a bridge . and the film doesn \\' t consistently question the military spirit as kubrick does in \" paths of glory \" . lean seems rather fascinated by the military hierarchies . this is also perceptible in the conversations between col . nicholson and col . saito . in this regard it is symptomatic that shears , who doubts the military logic , is presented as a somehow unpleasant person . the audience is supposed to applaud col . nicholson \\' s perseverance concerning the question if his officers shall work on the bridge or not . the spectators are supposed to neglect the risks col . nicholson takes for his men . ( the plot by - passes these risks . ) that means , the picture isn \\' t perfect . but it has a lot of virtues as well . \" the bridge on the river kwai \" shows the \" madness \" of war and what it can produce in people \\' s minds . it shows how colonel nicholson becomes possessed by the idea of being a hero and that others ( like shears ) get cynics . and lean \\' s film is an interesting study of characters with clashing interests . these points and the sometimes ironic dialogue make this film an anti - war film ( despite inconsistencies in the treatment of this theme ) . david lean \\' s direction is really effective and atmospherically perfect . his film is highly suspenseful , especially in its dramatic ( if not wholly plausible ) showdown . the film is also well - photographed and has an apt score . alec guinness does a magnificent job of bringing col . nicholson to life and making him such an interesting character . the other actors deliver fine performances as well . i like this extraordinary film despite its weaknesses .

second piece of film he ever liked . he \\' s a not - bad director because , hell , he is always interesting to watch ( if not occasionally moronic - exhibit a : \" days of thunder \" ) , but the reason he \\' s not great is because he \\' s too technical and calculated . his shots are perfectly executed , and leave nothing to the imagination , and they \\' re always making sure you \\' re paying attention . this is incredibly annoying , and it reduces \" enemy of the state \" to a mechanical mishmash of flashy images that never expand the mind at any great depths , but still manage to entertain without any real problems . despite never actually becoming great , it \\' s never actually boring and it \\' s always intriguing . watching the government set - up smith is endlessly fascinating , and since we care about smith \\' s likeable protagonist , we are set - up for a good two hours worth of tom clancy - esque entertainment . add the best big cast this side of the annual woody allen film ( everyone from gabriel byrne to dan butler pop up for cameos ) , and you \\' ve got a good old fashioned escapist drama which does all the thinking for you so that you never have to actually question the debate over personal privacy and so you can follow will smith \\' s plight without a minute \\' s worth of boredom .',\n",

and yes that is as complex as this movie \\' s observations get . the characters are stupid and shallow , with not one registering as anything more . the plot concerns vapid over sexed twentysomethings on an all night hunt for carnal pleasure , then the after math ( the morning after ) of such events . we meet the characters as they speak directly to us , confiding in us with their idiotic ruminations on intimacy . i would normally go into the characters and the actors who play them , giving you the pros and cons , but for this film i cannot . i \\' m not trying to be clever or witty , but i honestly hardly remember anything that would set them apart from the others . with the exception of trent ( played by ron livingston as a bargain basement patrick bateman ) , the rest fade into each other -- a patchwork of fake breasts , defined abs , pearly white teeth , and creamy , flawless skin . i vaguely recall brad rowe as the sensitive one , only because his character gets the worst lines ( \" sex without love equals violence \" ) . in between all the confessionals , cristoffer films everything like a headache commercial , with blurry slo mos and dramatic head turning . the fact that this director at one point won a pulitzer prize completely baffles me . this film is made without one iota of intelligence or insight into the generation that its tag line claims to be defining . if body shots is meant to say that all twentysometyhings are idiotic and f * * k - obsessed , fine , i don \\' t have any problem with a film that tries to persuade me to think a certain way , but cristoffer only gives us one side . additionally that one side isn \\' t even entertaining ; the characters indulge in buggery without an ounce of sexiness . or realism . one sexual encounter takes place outside a club on a chain link fence between the two most sensitive characters . they suddenly have vigorous intercourse with each other for no apparent reason ( other than that they both happen to be standing next to each other ? ? ? alas , if it could only be that easy ? ? ? kidding of course ) , then , not only isn \\' t it erotic , it isn \\' t real . it doesn \\' t feel like an authentic sexual encounter . every f * * k scene in this film ( and there are many ) is treated in the same unsexy manner . body shots makes fornication dirtier than the most scummy porno film . it shows us none of the pleasure that should go along with it , and most of all , it fails to show us why its characters love making it so much if they seem to hate the act of actually doing it . the resulting search for nookie ( and you can take that cookie ? ? ? ) over one night leaves us with several tedious plot lines to follow . the main concern is much ado over a rape that may or may not have occurred . the film shows us two separate versions of the possible rape ( one where it is consensual the other where it is not ) and in both versions the young actress playing the possible victim gets her shirt torn off . this is a topic that could be interestingly explored if done intelligently , and if memory serves me i can \\' t think of one film that has done so , and yes i saw the accused which may be one of the most overrated movies of the 80 \\' s next to wall street . unfortunately nobody gives us reason to care , not the writer , the director or the actors nearly all of whom seem to have wandered off the set of a noxious 90210 spin off . paul thomas anderson approached boogie nights in a manner similar to what cristoffer does here , though boogie nights succeeded . it was similarly moralistic , but it gave us two different viewpoints ; it showed us how the lifestyle of porn enticed its characters , and it showed us the possible fall - out of such a decision . the characters in boogie nights were as idiotic as the characters are here , but anderson seemed to care about them . he gave them heart . cristoffer gives them nothing but raging hormones . he preaches to us , by using his characters to preach to us . this is not the way to get any message across . why not just direct a public service announcement on the perils of hittin \\' skins ? cristofer kind of does that , though without an ounce of insight , and with a helping of leering exploitation .',\n",

( see the relic for a particularly putrid example . ) perhaps it is simply too easy to forget the necessary binding ingredient : effort and ideas . deep rising meets these two requirements part way , but not enough to salvage the film . treat williams is finnegan , the leader of a small boat crew who hire out their services ( and their boat ) for any activity . . . no questions asked . this time , however , they may have gone too far . their passengers , led by the ominous wes studi , are the type of multi - national terrorist squads usually only seen in die hard films . and their cargo . . . let \\' s just say it has very high explosive potential . what is the target of these thieves ? why , the argonauticus , of course , a high tech luxury cruise yacht on its maiden voyage . but something else is hunting the argonauticus . . . something ancient and deadly . by the time the thieves arrive , nearly everyone on board the ship has been killed . and now the creature senses fresh meat ! so , you have the thieves and their mercenary boat crew , joining forces with the surviving passengers ( including the ship owner canton ( anthony heald ) , and a thief with less lofty goals , trillian ( famke janssen ) ) against the terror from the deep . and the monster gets to pick them off one by one . fortunately for the creature , this particular band of criminals happens to be the dumbest the world can offer . why else would they indulge in petty squabbling while they watch their friends become fish food . if there \\' s a more clarion call for unity , i don \\' t know what it might be . it \\' s pretty easy to guess who will get killed off when . there are no surprises in that the most interesting characters seem to last until the end . for the most part , the watery tentacles seem to be acting on the audience \\' s impulses to get rid of the most boring characters first . ( although i wonder if the filmmakers might have extended djimon hounsou \\' s life a bit if they knew this would be released so soon after his acclaim for amistad . ) treat williams is a passable hero , and famke janssen does her best julia roberts impersonation . but while wes studi and anthony heald are particularly slimy , very little of the rest of the company stand out in any way . the biggest treat in the film , however , has to be pantucci , kevin j . o \\' connor \\' s whining engine - boy , under finnegan \\' s employ . his constant quips may be a bit over - written , but they manage to capture the same vein of nerve - addled humor that bill paxton delivered as hudson in aliens ( or todd graff as hippie in the abyss , for that matter ) . it \\' s just a stock part ( the comic - relief character ) , but it almost makes this tired alien clone bearable . as far as the monster goes , although the cgi is done well , the creature has no logical consistency . think back to the great ( or even just good ) movie monsters . they all had a set of \" rules \" about what they could do , and how and why they would do it . part of the joy of those films was slowly discovering , along with the heroes , just what those rules are . the tentacle monster in deep rising doesn \\' t have a set of rules . . . or if it does , not a very good one . it merely eats ( or drinks , as the case may be ) , and there is no rhyme or reason for what it does in order to do so . the film never explains why the argonauticus is attacked in the first place . it simply happens . the action scenes are decent , but few are noteworthy . the film definitely does suffer from its proximity to titanic . deep rising \\' s peril in the water scenes pale next to cameron \\' s ( but can you really blame them ) . unfortunately , deep rising \\' s efforts are more on par with speed 2 . on the plus side , however , the film \\' s closing image shows some promise for a potentially interesting ( but unlikely ) sequel . perhaps you \\' d be better off waiting for that one .',\n",

       " ('after hearing reviews for woody allen \\' s upteenth movie in history , \" celebrity , \" range from terribly boring to just so - so , my heart lept when the opening images of the film closely resembled that of \" manhattan , \" my personal favorite from my personal favorite director of all time . woody allen \\' s films almost never rely on visual flair over textual flair , so when one of his films closely resembles the one time that these two entities fit hand - in - hand ( \" manhattan \" really is one of the best - looking films i \\' ve ever seen , beautiful black and white photography of the city \\' s best areas , etc . ) , a fan can \\' t help but feel visibly moved . the film opens up , with the usual credits with plain white font over black backgrounds , and an old ironic standard playing on the soundtrack , but then the screen fills with a gorgeous dull gray sky , with the word \" help \" being spelled with an airplane . beethoven \\' s 5th blasts on the soundtrack . the city seems to stop to take notice of this moment , and it \\' s all rather lovely to look at . and then we cut to a film crew , shooting this as the film \\' s hilariously banal key moment in the film , where the lead actress in the film ( melanie griffith , looking as buxom and beautiful as ever ) has to realize something \\' s wrong with her life or whatever . it \\' s a terribly stale scene for a woody allen film , with the great opening shots or without , and my heart sank and i soon got used to the fact that once again , a new film of his was not going to be as great as his past works ( though , for the record , last year \\' s \" deconstructing harry \" came awfully close ) . what the hell has happened to him ? the man who once could be relied on for neurotic freshness in cinema has not become less funny , but his films have become less insightful and more like he tossed them together out of unfinished ideas . \" bullets over broadway , \" though wonderful , relies on irony to pull a farce that just never totally takes off . \" mighty aphrodite \" is more full of great moments and lines than a really great story . \" everyone says i love you \" was more of a great idea than a great film . even \" deconstructing harry \" is admittingly cheap in a way , even if it does top as one of his most truly hilarious films . if anything , the reception of \" celebrity \" by everyone should tip allen off to the fact that this time , it \\' s not the audience and critics who are wrong about how wonderful his film is : it \\' s him . \" celebrity \" is , yes , a good film , but it \\' s only marginally satisfying as a woody allen film . instead of creating the great woody allen world , he \\' s created a world out of a subject he knows only a bit about . and he \\' s fashioned a film that is based almost entirely on his uninformed philosophy of celebrities , so that it plays like a series of skits with minor connections . it \\' s like \" la dolce vita \" without the accuracy , the right amount of wit , and the correct personal crisis . woody , becoming more insecure in his old age , choses to drop the woody allen character in on the world of celebrities , and then hang him and all his flaws up for scrutiny , and does this by casting not himself but brit actor kenneth branagh in the lead . much has been said about his performance - dead on but irritating , makes one yearn for the real thing , blah blah blah - but to anyone who actually knows the woody allen character knows that branagh \\' s performance , though featuring some of the same mannerisms ( stuttering , whining , lots o \\' hand gestures ) , is hardly a warts - and - all impersonation . branagh brings along with him little of the woody allen charm , which actually allows for his character \\' s flaws to be more apparent . woody \\' s a flawed guy , and we know it , but we love him anyway , because he \\' s really funny and really witty and really intelligent . branagh \\' s allen is a bit more flat - out bad , but with the same charm so that , yes , we like him , but we \\' re still not sure if he \\' s really a good person or not . his character , lee simon , is first seen on the set of the aforementioned movie , hits on extra actress winona ryder , then goes off to interview griffith , who takes him to her childhood home where he makes a pass at her , and she denies him . . . sorta . we then learn , through flashbacks , that lee has been sucked into trying to be a celebrity thanks to a mid - life crisis and an appearance at his high school reunion . he has since quit his job as a travel journalist and become a gossip journalist of sorts , covering movie sets and places where celebrities congregate , so that he can meet them , and maybe sell his script ( a bank robbery movie \" but with a deep personal crisis \" ) . as such , he has divorced his wife of several years ( allen regular judy davis ) , and continues on a quest for sexual happiness , boucing from girlfriend to girlfriend and fling to fling over the course of the film . after griffith comes his escapades with a model ( charlize theron ) who is \" polymorphously perverse \" ( glad to see allen is using new jokes , ha ha ) , who takes him for a wild ride not different from that of the anita ekberg segment of \" la dolce vita . \" following are his safe relationship with smart working woman famke janssen , a relationship that almost assures him success , and his continued escapades with ryder , whom he fancies most of all . his story is juxtaposed with that of davis , who flips out , but stumbles onto happiness when she runs into a handsome , friendly tv exec ( joe mantegna ) who lands her a job that furthers her career to national status . while lee is fumbling about , selfishly trying to ensure his own happiness , davis becomes happy ( \" i \\' ve become the kind of woman i \\' ve always hated . . . and i \\' m loving it . \" ) without doing a thing . the result is a film of highs and mediums . the mediums are what take up most of the film , with sitations and scenes which don \\' t exactly work but you can \\' t help but pat allen on the back for trying . but other places are really great scenes . the opening . the sequence with theron , which is so good that i wished it hadn \\' t ended . a banana scene with bebe neuwirth ( droll as ever ) . and , perhaps the best sequence : a romp with hot - as - hell teen idol , brandon darrow , played by none other than leo dicaprio , who is so un - dicaprio - esque that if any of this fans could sit through this film , they \\' d never look at him the same way . he ignites the screen with intensity , and spares nothing in showing his character as narcissistically tyrannical , and totally heartbreaking for lee , who comes to him to talk about his script that he has read , and finds himself on a wild all - day ride with him . they go to atlantic city to watch a fight , they gamble , and they wind up in his hotel room , where darrow gets it on with his flame ( gretchen mol ) and he lends him one of the leftover groupies . allen \\' s writing in these scenes are so good that just for them , i \\' d almost recommend the film . almost . but what i really liked about this film is despite the fact that it \\' s a mess , despite the fact that what this film really needs is a good old fashioned rewrite by allen himself , it \\' s still a smart and insightful film . though some of the jokes are either stale or misplaced ( some seem too cartoonish , even for this environment ) , allen still manages to get across that this film is not exactly about celebrities , as it may seem to be ( if it were , it \\' d be extremely out - of - touch ) , but about those who want to be celebrities , and how they equate celebrity - hood with happiness . we never get close enough to the actual celebrities to see if they \\' re really happy ( they may appear to be on the surface . . . ) , but we do get close enough to lee and davis \\' character . lee is obsessed with the phenomenon , while davis takes is at arm \\' s length , and never gets too involved in what it is , and soon becomes one herself . besides , it \\' s witty , and it does have the one thing that no other film has but allen \\' s : that great woody allen feel . it may be not exactly fresh and lively or totally brilliant in its depiction of its subject , and yes , as a part of woody allen \\' s oeuvre , it \\' s merely a blip ( no \" annie hall \" but it \\' s no \" shadows and fog \" either ) , but it goes to prove that no one can make a film like him , and only he and maybe godard could possibly take a totally horrible metaphor , like the one in the beginning , and make it work not once but twice .',\n",

       " ('the summer movie season is always the biggest and brightest season for movies throughout the year . we are introduced to blockbuster hits that are usually trashed by critics , loved by the people , and make tons of money at the box office . this year , the tradition continues with an update on the universal 1932 classic , the mummy . i have always been a sucker for this kind of monster movies , and i always seem to be the only critic who really likes them . that tradition continues as well with this fun special effects extravaganza . in the mummy , the up and coming brendan fraser stars as the adventurous explorer rick o \\' connell . he teams up with a curious , clumsy librarian named evelyn , played by rachel weisz , to find the mysterious city of the dead , hamunaptra . evelyn loves egypt , and would truly like to visit the city that people call a fable . rick has claimed he has been to hamunaptra during a battle , and that \\' s why she chose him to lead her there . also tagging along on the journey to the city of the dead is evelyn \\' s brother , jonathan , played by john hannah ( sliding doors ) . now in hamunaptra , the three uncover \" the book of the dead . \" the curious evelyn unlocks the book , reads from it , and now the body of the ancient egyptian imhotep ( arnold vosloo ) becomes alive and is out to kill the ones who opened and read from the book . along with imhotep arising from the dead , the ten curses of egypt become in full effect , launching unbelievable forces against the three and another group who set out to find hamunaptra . not only is imhotep furious with those who awoke him , he is also out to restore the life of his girlfriend that lost her life long ago in ancient egypt . don \\' t expect huge things out of the mummy , but just expect to have a good time . this movie is extremely campy and plays out like an old horror film with beefed up special effects , which may turn off some viewers . on the other hand , this type of film is one of my favorites , but that \\' s up to you to decide . there is one thing that definitely not campy or corny about the mummy though . the state of the art special effects take you into a completely different world . we are dazzled by faces rising out of the desert , swarms of beetles and locusts , and even creatures crawling under a human \\' s skin . these may have been in other movies before , but not like in the mummy . as of now , the mummy holds the title for best special effects of this year , but all this could change when star wars episode 1 : the phantom menace is released into theaters across the country . in the past , brendan fraser has played mainly comedic roles . when playing \" george \" in disney \\' s george of the jungle , he was mainly not known by anyone . i would say that gods and monsters is the film that gave him a name , and now the mummy will give him a name amongst teens . in the mummy , fraser gets to play an action hero , and i liked him in this sort of role over the comedic role , as in the films blast from the past and george of the jungle . although brendan fraser is great , rachel weisz gives the best performance among the cast . weisz really reminded me of a character from an old , horror film . the way she acts , looked , and talked all reminded me of someone not from this time . evelyn is probably the only character that was likable , considering that the other characters , like john hannah \\' s , didn \\' t get much personal attention . in many films , when different genres are mixed , the mixing usually works , and i like it for the most part . in the mummy though , not all of the mixing works . there are some scenes that have a lot of potential horror , some with potential comedy , some with potential drama , and some with potential pure action , but the film tries to mix them together too often for the mixing to work . the mummy could have gotten an \" a \" rating from me if it had gone purely with one of these . i didn \\' t mind the corny one - liners here and there during action sequences , but it certainly could have done without them . the cinematography is amazing in the mummy . particularly in one scene depicting ancient egypt , we are taken into a very fun portrayal of egypt , mummies , and the treasures left behind by the ancient egyptians . the costume design in the film is also up there with the great cinematography . from ancient egyptians outfits to original troops outfits , the costumes are always top notch . the bottom line - with the mummy , the summer is off to its usually great start .',\n",

       " ('the cryptic teaser trailer has been unspooling in moviehouses for quite sometime now : \" it mu5t be found . \" so what , exactly , is the fifth element ? after seeing luc besson \\' s ambitious , much - shrouded - in - secrecy science fiction fantasy , i could not help but be let down by the actual answer , which is not nearly as exciting nor clever as one would think . but what is far from a letdown is the film as a whole , a wildly imaginative feast for the senses that does what all the best science fiction films do -- create a universe unlike any other presented on the silver screen . the biggest irony of the fifth element is that the one thing that has been kept under such tight wraps -- the actual storyline -- is the most conventional , dismayingly so , element ( pun intended ) of the film . speaking in the vaguest possible terms , the basics of the plot are as follows : in the year 2259 , a great force of evil threatens to consume the earth , and only the four elements -- earth , wind , fire , and water -- united with a fifth element can stop it . figuring into all of this are new york cabbie korben dallas ( bruce willis ) ; a shady , southern - drawling entrepreneur by the name of zorg ( the hilariously hammy gary oldman , picking up where he left off in besson \\' s the professional ) ; a priest ( ian holm ) ; and a mysterious creature named leeloo ( milla jovovich ) . all of the pieces come together in a tidy and somewhat underwhelming -- and unsurprising -- fashion , but there is no denying that this basic story holds some intrinsic interest . what remains interesting and exciting , however , after brief glimpses is the fascinating world besson has created with production designer dan weil , director of photography thierry arbogast , visual effects supervisor mark stetson , and the crew at digital domain . the look is absolutely mesmerizing right from the opening moments to the last . the frenzied cityscape of new york , with its vibrant day - glo colors , tall buildings penetrating high into the clouds , and the swarm of cars , cabs , and other vehicles flying through labyrinthian skyways , is absolutely breathtaking to behold , especially in a wild car chase sequence early on in the film . but it would not have been a completely captivating vision if the people inhabiting the settings weren \\' t equally as interesting , and are they ever . in addition to the exotic menagerie of alien creatures that populate this world , from bulky robots to dog - like mangalores , the humans are outfitted in costumes by eccentric designer jean - paul gaulthier , best known for creating madonna \\' s pointy bustier get - up in her blonde ambition tour . gaulthier \\' s outlandish creations , such as a number worn by leeloo made entirely out of white straps , feel more at home in besson \\' s futuristic vision than on any fashion runway in the world ; they add to the sense of otherworldliness about the film . while besson \\' s bold vision is the biggest virtue of the film , it also could be its biggest obstacle to reaching a mass audience . for all its imagination , certain things about the film may be a bit too quirky and bizarre . i really do not know what middle america will make of the most outrageous character of the film , ruby rhod ( chris tucker ) , a flamboyant disc jockey who makes dennis rodman look conservative -- he makes a raucous entrance dressed in an animal print dress , sporting a blonde hairdo in the shape of a hair dryer , speaking in high pitches at rapid fire speed . at first this character \\' s hyper energy is funny , but the act wears out its welcome very quickly . not irritating , but just as strange , is a musical number by blue - skinned alien chanteuse diva ( maiwenn lebesco ) , who sings -- and dances -- an aria that is an unlikely blend of classical opera and techno . the tune , as with the entirety of longtime besson collaborator eric serra \\' s innovative score , is haunting , but it is also completely jarring . then there are the campy touches of humor besson and co - scripter robert mark kamen sprinkle throughout , which too often are silly and forced ; a comic sexual encounter between ruby rhod and a flight attendant is highly distracting and not very funny , to boot . the story \\' s weakness shines through in the climax and conclusion of the fifth element . while still visually and aurally spectacular , the events detailed are not as exciting nor powerful as they should be . the big , serious dramatic climax was met with more than a few snickers , and it ambitiously strives for a profundity which the film had not even begun to work toward . as such , at the end there is a sense that there was something bigger at work here , that there was still more left to be said about this story and these characters . this suspicion was confirmed by besson himself , who told me in the lobby following the screening ( imagine that , the filmmaker watching the film with the \" enemy \" -- the critics ) that what had made it to the screen was really just the first half of the lengthy original fifth element screenplay and that the second half -- now titled mr . shadow -- is still waiting to be made . still , despite the story problems , the fifth element is an artistic triumph for luc besson ; rarely does a filmmaker \\' s original vision come to the screen in all its audacious , undiluted glory . it is a fascinating example of how of one artist \\' s fervid imagination can transport an audience into an intoxicating fantasy world generally seen only in dreams .',\n",

       " ('with the release of gattaca , i began to wonder why all science fiction films deal with destructive aliens , or aliens in general . hollywood has given audiences plenty of thrills with those alien films , but what was usually lacking was a good story . . . and good characters . . . and good acting , etc ( contact being the exception ) . and for some reason , hollywood has never taken a look at the aliens here on earth . the closest , that i have seen anyway , was 2001 : a space odyssey , which made mankind an alien race themselves , being dwarfed by the technology which they created . now comes gattaca , another film about technology reigning supreme , except here on our planet . the difference between 2001 and this one is simple : gattaca is more frightening . most of the concepts of this movie are based on recent discoveries in genetic engineering . using this premise , writer / director andrew niccol creates some genuine suspense and thrills . unfortunately , due to a lack of advertising , i fear gattaca may fair horribly at the box office . since seeing the film , i have been asking people if they have seen gattaca . lately , however , i have been asking them if they have even heard of gattaca . most people don \\' t even realize that it is a film . despite this fact , i surely hope that the audience members who have seen this film will tell their friends about it . niccol \\' s film deserves more than what independence day made because it is smarter , better produced , and more realistic . gattaca begins in the 21st century . procreating is now done in a petri dish , and genetic engineering is the normal way of doing it . natural child birth is considered old - fashioned . we are introduced to jerome morrow ( ethan hawke ) , an employee of the gattaca space program . one of the directors of the program has been murdered , and the main suspect is one vincent freeman . the only problem is that jerome morrow is vincent freeman . vincent was born the natural way when his parents decided on bringing their first child into the world through love . however , after his birth , and through several genetic tests , doctors tell his parents that he will have a 99 % chance of a weak heart , as well as poor eye sight and a short life span . as a result , both parents decide to bring their next baby into the world via genetics . anton ( loren dean ) is produced without flaws , and the competition between brothers spawns . vincent has a dream to fly a solo - flight around the titan , the 14th moon of saturn , but because of his condition , gattaca , and society in general , forces him to do menial labor around the company . labeled an \" in - valid , \" vincent \\' s dream seems impossible , until he meets a black - market dna specialist , german ( tony shalhoub ) . german introduces him to a \" valid \" who has been paralized from the waste down due to an automobile accident . jerome morrow ( jude law ) agrees to give vincent all the proper identification tools ( urine , blood , skin and hair samples , etc . ) that he will need to get past gattaca \\' s tight security . in exchange , vincent will provide jerome with the rent money and friendship . after the murder , however , his dreams are put at risk due to one of vincent \\' s eyelashes left at the scene of the crime . irene cassini ( uma thurman ) is a genetically flawed \" valid \" working for gattaca , and she begins to fall in love with vincent / jerome . gattaca is one of the best science fiction films i have seen in a long time . only two other intelligent science fiction films have come out in the past two years ( contact and the arrival ) and gattaca will rank among them . unfortunately , whenever one intelligent film comes out against special effects - laden films , it normally gets buried . the second best thing about gattaca is the production design by jan roelfs . the orange glow of gattaca \\' s scenes are impressive , but the sets deserve most of the credit . the sets are very well done , creating a futuristic sense , but not too futuristic as to alienate viewers . as we look at the designs , we realize that these buildings aren \\' t too far into the future . this brings the plot even more credibility as genetic engineering becomes more possible by every passing day . the best thing , however , is the plot . the story is more than your average sci - fi / thriller . at its heart , it develops a theme which is never overpowering but is always present . perhaps niccol is warning our race about the changes genetic tampering could bring . would our society become a bunch of soulless zombies ? maybe human nature is a result of mankind \\' s flaws . if we get rid of flaws , do we get rid of dreams as well ? niccol \\' s intelligent script handles all these questions extremely well , and the result is an incredibly smart thriller set against a dramatic story , or vice versa . the power of the actors brings a lot of credibility to flat characters . while flat may sound like a poor job on niccol \\' s part , it actually enhances the meaning behind the story . ethan hawke has developed into a handsome adult actor , giving his best performance of his lifetime so far . his curiosity and motivation pushes his character past all the discouraging remarks from his parents and \" valid \" peers . uma thurman is . . . well , uma thurman . her character is slightly underdeveloped , but the story isn \\' t about her . however , thurman gives a lot of depth to the flat character . jude law gives the most complex performance of the film with the most disturbingly realistic character . he provides several nice touches , and his final scene is a very touching and heartwrenching one . loren dean gives a nice performance in his well - developed character . dean is also responsible for some of the most suspenseful scenes in the movie . alan arkin portrays one of the detectives with a little less more excitement than with his psychiatrist in grosse pointe blank . still , he does a good job . gore vidal and xander berkeley both provide some very good supporting roles , and berkeley also gives a heartfelt discussion towards the end of the film . gattaca is rated pg - 13 for brief violent images , language , some sexuality , and nudity . despite the somber and desolate mood of the entire film , i wasn \\' t exactly prepared for the ending which left me feeling empty . it turned me off slightly , but then i realized that everything turned out the way it should have . if this had been a typical hollywood film , it would have ended much differently . however , with all the mindless science fiction films out there , it is nice to have a film which doesn \\' t talk down to its audience ( i especially like the ironic title and how it consists of the four letters which make up the genetic coding : g , t , c , and a ) . instead , it provides some much needed entertainment which gives us science fiction fanatics just what we want : a science fiction film with morals behind it . whatever happened to giving the audience a lesson while entertaining ? hopefully more writers and directors will learn from gattaca . . . and hopefully audiences will too . p . s . personal note to p . j . gladnick : how dare you call this film the worst film of the year . i can \\' t even begin to image what film you do like . that frightens me beyond anything .',\n",

       " ('seen february 15 , 1998 on home video ( borrowed from chris wessell ) . when it comes to modern gangster movies , it \\' s really difficult to describe and review them without making comparisons to other films of the genre and / or just using the word \" routine . \" i \\' ve always subscribed to the philosophy that any idea ( no matter how many times it \\' s been used before ) can provide for a good story and \" donnie brasco \" clinches this idea . it \\' s not unlike most of the great films of the genre , yet it never apes another \\' s style as it has a good layer of authenticity , even if its core is a tad stale . the film starts off in typical fashion by defining its atmosphere of new york city in the late 1970s and the mobsters who inhibit it . we meet lefty ( pacino ) , an aging wiseguy who can still walk the walk and talk the talk . he and his associates go through the generic motions you expect to see in crime films like this . somehow he comes across donnie brasco ( depp ) , a younger guy with a lot of spunk who isn \\' t afraid of lefty and his rep , and even manages to befriend him after lefty was ready to kill him . it \\' s clear donnie is new to the life and lefty recognizes this immediately , telling him all the tricks of the trade . i have never seen this technique of actually revealing the mafioso idiosyncrasies done before and for this the film deserves credit . however , we soon realize donnie is actually joe pistone , an fbi agent working undercover - a character who symbolizes the viewer as he will soon be purged into the lifestyle and treated as a newcomer . the first act works as a guided to ot of rhetoric about wiseguy honor , a brief history of the mob , definitions of their slang , and where their money comes from and who it goes to . the screenplay is rather sketchy on the details surrounding these elements , however , the fact they are mentioned at all is quite original . most gangster movies seem to be made with the notion the viewer already knows how the mob works ( probably from watching other gangster movies ) , and although this attitude comes across , the film tries to fill in all the holes where and when it can and the effort is appreciable . thankfully the film doesn \\' t become too caught up in the tedious details of organized crime , and instead opts for character development . much of the story is told simply through the interaction between lefty and donnie . pacino is outstanding here as the pathetic hood who speaks of his job in the same manner any blue collar worker would . he \\' s old and exhausted but seems to enjoy what he does , just as anyone loyal to the same employer for over 30 years might be . we learn of his accomplishments , which are quite impressive within their context , and when he complains about not being made top boss , it \\' s easy to sympathize with him . newell constantly plays up this aspect , making it a major theme which works well in the long run . as donnie is constantly impressing and even one - upping lefty , it \\' s hard to tell which emotion is more powerful : the fact donnie is getting closer to nailing the mob ; or the fact lefty has once again been over shadowed . most of the film tells the story of donnie \\' s life in mafia , which creates for many sub - plots and individual conflicts , but doesn \\' t always seem to come together as a whole . the storytelling is genuinely interesting throughout , even when the motions the characters go through seem familiar . the resonance to donnie \\' s actual assignment varies , he often reports back to the feds with detail of his progress , but it doesn \\' t always seem to have much meaning . back home , his wife maggie ( heche ) is ready to divorce him because he \\' s never a and the family is suffering . since this is based on a true story i wouldn \\' t doubt this would happen , although the way it is handled often borders on the melodramatic . my only major complaint is the film seems to have no final act , or at least any real sense of closure . a climax of sorts does occur , but there \\' s little feeling of a payoff . we get a happy ending , which is good , but perhaps a sad ending would have been more powerful . aside from a few minor , general flaws , \" donnie brasco \" manages to be a solid piece of storytelling and character development . it may be routine , but it \\' s good , and that \\' s respectful .',\n",

       " (\"to paraphrase a song title from an earlier disney movie , mulan is a whole new world . the mouse factory ' s latest feature is a treasure , featuring magnificent animation , a strong story and finely drawn characters . mulan is the story of a fiesty , head - strong young woman who , unlike other disney heroines , isn ' t seeking her prince charming , mulan ' s motivations are simple ; to save her father , serve her country and find a place for herself in a world in which females have no say . the story of mulan takes place in ancient china at a time when the huns have invaded the nation . the emperor has called for a conscription , one man from each family to join the army and defend the nation . mulan ' s crippled father is called , but mulan sneaks off , steals his armor and takes his place . mulan is a saga of courage and self - discovery . yet , despite the grim backdrop of war , it is a lively tale of self - reliance and brain - over - brawn that even the smallest child can appreciate and enjoy . the movie utilizes a strong corps of asian - american talent as the voices for the main characters , including the wonderful ming - na wen ( the joy luck club ) as mulan , b . d . wong as shang , mulan ' s commanding officer and later love interest , pat morita as the emperor and the veteran soon - tek oh as mulan ' s proud , but loving father . also adding to the proceedings is eddie murphy as mushu the dragon , sent by mulan ' s ancestors to watch over and help the young woman . his fast , wise - cracking , hip - talking mushu may seem out of place , but it ' s a crowd pleasing performance , especially for the youngsters . the movie features only a couple of songs , fewer than most previous disney animated flicks , but mulan ' s are winners . the music by matthew wilder and lyrics by david zippel fit nicely into the plot . the overall score by jerry goldsmith also is a plus . mulan is a treat , more powerful than hercules , with more heart than the hunchback of notre dame . at about 85 minutes , mulan moves rapidly , and will hold the attention of youngsters from beginning to the end . mulan will set a new standard by which future animated efforts by disney and other studios will have to work hard to attain . also , it is hoped that the success of mulan , and there is no doubt that it will prove to be a popular vehicle , will spur an interest for more movies with oriential or asian - american themes so as to provide more substantial roles for the talented performers who gave their voices for this production . it would be nice to see them on screen as well as hear them . committed to lifelong learning through effective communication\",\n",

       " ('54 is dull , perfunctory , uninspired , and boring . a greater writer might have created a lyrical sentence for each of those adjectives , flowing in lovely arangements with soaring metaphors . i , however , would rather cut to the chase . 54 is dull , perfunctory , uninspired , and boring . there is nothing in it -- not a glimpse of depth , nor a shimmer of intelligence or insight . there is no electricity in any of the scenes , or a moment of interest in the story or its subplots . and it \\' s underdeveloped , and features an array of bland characters played by actors who think they \\' re in this year \\' s boogie nights . they are so wrong . the picture has been assembled by mark christopher . based on this film , i don \\' t know how he got a job in the business . 54 is supposed to be an amazing insight into the world of the dance club of the same name , which originated in the 70s and closed down in the 80s . i don \\' t know if this film went into production after boogie nights was released , but christopher has managed to plagiarize paul thomas anderson \\' s brilliant work in every possible way , from the framework of the plot down to the style of the cinematography . what it lacks is everything that made boogie nights great : depth , intelligence , energy , fascinating characters , and challenging themes . 54 can \\' t even measure up to the last days of disco , which is flawed , but still smart and entertaining . it \\' s remarkably bad timing , i \\' d say , to release a film this tedious after a couple of noteworthy pictures of the same kind . i have exaggerated , though : there is one interesting character , and one terrific performance . that character is steve rubell , played with more perceptiveness by mike myers than this limp production deserves . steve rubell is the owner of studio 54 , and if christopher had focused on him , then myers could have forced a good film out of this wreck all by himself . alas , we are instead guided to endure the trials of a young man named shane ( ryan phillippe ) , a going - nowhere new jersey teen who gets a job in the club , thanks to rubell \\' s homosexual impulses . it \\' s here that he meets his friends , the array of uninteresting characters : his co - worker , greg ( brecklin meyer ) , his wife , anita ( salma hayek ) , and , of course , the love interest , julie black ( neve campbell ) . shane is just an innocent young fool in the beginning , and he has a reasonably sturdy home life . ( some of the scenes with his father border on interesting , while heather matarazzo , who plays his sister , pushes phillippe off the screen . ) but he decides to envelop himself in the disco scene , and succumb to peer pressure and to drugs . why his \" friends \" push him into drugs is never really explained , but the fact that they are \" friends \" is questioned only is superficial ways ( greg gets really mad at shane because he \\' s been elevated to bartender status ) . there isn \\' t a single conflict that takes center stage , except that shane has some kind of unexplored reservation with the business in which he works . most of the film is dumb , and most of the dialogue is inane . there \\' s a scene late in the film in which shane confronts julie black , and , in the next scene , they \\' re arm - in - arm without a bit of development . then , they \\' re kissing in a bowling alley ! this is five minutes of material , thrown into the picture at the last minute ( well past the one - hour mark , and this isn \\' t a long film to begin with ) . campbell is a talented actress , but she needs a role that gives her a little depth . this one doesn \\' t . and phillippe has almost no presence whatsoever ; this performance pales in comparison to mark whalberg \\' s star - making role in boogie nights . he seems dumb and misguided , and his voice never changes tone . i guess he was picked for the color of his hair and the shape of his body , but he seems pretty lanky to me . he \\' s all wrong for a lead role , but it doesn \\' t help that christopher has forgotten to develop his characters . by the end of 54 , shane \\' s most notable trait is his stupid , fake accent . the rest of the performances are wasted . hayek is an energetic , talented young actress , and does almost nothing here . meyer is endearing , but allowed to be no deeper than cardboard . only myers , by sheer force of talent , manages to rise above christopher \\' s wading - pool of a script . rubell has been written just as depthless as the rest of the characters , but myers is good enough to inject subtleties that help round out the performance . in fact , myers is the sole reason to see 54 , and all it really does is make you wish that the film had revolved around him . i \\' ve read that studio 54 has been recreated down to the last detail . frankly , i don \\' t care . it \\' s easy to recreate something technical like this . a fairly skilled production designer and a few carpenters can manage such a task . besides , christopher keeps the lights so low that the sets are invisible , anyway . aside from myers \\' performance , 54 is a complete failure . it \\' s dull , perfunctory , uninspired , and boring . some may find my comparisons to boogie nights unfair , but they \\' re so obvious to me . in any event , 54 is pallid without the contrast . it doesn \\' t even work as mindless entertainment : it \\' s so shallow that the most escapist viewers are likely to dismiss it . so , don \\' t forget those key words : dull , perfunctory , uninspired , and boring . everything else i said was just padding .',\n",

by really cheap surrealism , and moronic exchanges like this . oh , and it gets better . a similar bit of dialogue is said in the middle of , oh i dunno , the fiftieth sex scene in this film ( i \\' m not counting the several masturbation scenes ) . in it , one of the protagonists is humping away on top of another , and he says to her something along the lines of \" do you ever wonder what life is all about ? \" sorry , man : foreplay takes place before the act of coitus . of course , what do you expect : the film was written and directed by a guy who can \\' t even spell his first name right ( yes , i know it \\' s a cheap joke , but it had to be done ) . \" the doom generation \" is advertised as a road trip movie about people who go around killing others who attack them , and also as another \" teen angst \" film ( one of the slogans is \" teen is a four - letter word \" - hardy har har ) . it \\' s a film about two angsty teens - amy blue ( rose macgowan , who would later play the buxom tatum in \" scream \" ) and jordon white ( james duval , who would go on to play randy quaid \\' s son in \" independence day \" ) - who pick up an angsty homicidal maniac , xavier red ( jonathan schaech , who would go on to play the angsty lead guitarist in \" that thing you do ! \" - and by the way , do you get the symbolism ? red , white , and blue ? huh ? huh ? ) , and go on a road trip where three things happen , in no order : 1 ) they have sex ; 2 ) they run into weird people ; 3 ) they kill them . the film is basically a remix of a bunch of other far superior films . gregg araki obviously has seen such films as \" easy rider , \" \" natural born killers , \" and \" kalifornia , \" and tries to borrow elements from all these films and make something which is like a pop culture reference guide . but what he forgets is these films either represented something that this film does not , or that they dug deep into their subjects and brought something out of them to make them deeper . \" the doom generation \" doesn \\' t want to do this ; it just wants to show everything in a surreal manner for the sole reason that araki does not want to deal with them on any kind of real level . he wants to show everything in a weird manner , and forgets what the scenes are supposed to be about . here \\' s one scene , an earlier scene in the film : amy and jordan go into a quick - e mart type place to get food and other stuff . amy is smoking , and the clerk , an asian man mind you ( i love how racist this film is , i really do ) , tells her to put it out . she tells him to fuck off or something to that note . he points a shotgun at her , and she puts it out reluctantly . jordan makes two hot dogs , and takes them to the counter . the cash register rings up \" 6 . 66 \" ( oh , and this symbolism doesn \\' t stop here ) . jordan checks for his wallet but it \\' s really in the car . he asks amy for it , but she left her wallet in the car as well . the clerk brings out his shotgun again and asks for the money . they say they don \\' t have it . he gets ready to kill them , but then xavier , who they ditched in the middle of nowhere a scene before , pops out of nowhere , fights with the clerk , and ends with him blowing the clerk \\' s head clean off ( clean wound , mind you ) . the head is shown flying through the air , and lands in a fryer , where it begins to scream . i don \\' t really object to this kind of sick violence , but this scene is in the film for one reason and one reason only : to gross you out . araki thinks that if he takes everything to the extreme , he \\' ll make some kind of art . wrong . it takes a kind of resistance to make gore art . when george romero made \" dawn of the dead , \" a very gory flick even for today , he had control over everything and still was able to make everything sick . same goes for peter jackson \\' s disgustingly gory \" dead alive , \" which features a 30 minute long fest of blood , guts , dismemberments , flesh chewing , and other assorted stuff , all ending with a guy with a lawn mower strapped to his body , taking out all sorts of zombies . it was sick , but it was also satirical , and controled . a scene like this has no purpose in the film , and it sticks out from everything else that happens . here \\' s a couple other scenes : jordan and amy have sex in a bath tub and xavier watches , masturbates , and then licks the semen from his hand ; xavier and amy have sex and jordan watches from the window , masturbates , and falls backwards ; a man attacks the trio , and is stabbed in the crotch by a giant sword ( put there just so this could happen ) ; a fast food employee stalks the trio , and his arm is shot off by xavier ; and various other annoyances . also , look for about a million camoes from a wide assortment of people , who probably didn \\' t really know what they were getting into when they signed up to do it ( just like peter o \\' toole , helen mirren , malcolm macdowell , and john gielgud probably didn \\' t when they signed to be in \" caligula \" ) . people such as indie actors parker posey and nicky katt , alternative rock stars skinny puppy and perry farrel , hollywood madam heidi fleiss , christopher \" peter brady \" mcknight , amanda bearse , and margaret cho all grace the screen for a matter of seconds , then disappear so that we can return to the annoying main plot line . why are they here ? so that we can all point to them and say \" hey , look it \\' s ( fill in the blank ) ! wow ! \" gimme a break . the film \\' s meaning is pretty easy to detect : that , you know , teens are so precious , and the world is such a horrible place , that when the two entities collide , there \\' s a giant explosion of horrific violence . otherwise defined as \" teen angst , \" or the belief that being a teenager is a horrible thing and that the world is too bad for you . look , i \\' m 19 years old . i went through a very brief teen angst thing which curiously lasted about as long as my taste in nirvana did . i \\' ve since moved on to \" i don \\' t really know what to do with my life \" phase , but the teen angst phase is something which is so annoyingly sophomoric and ignorant that any film that thinks they \\' re dealing with it on any kind of serious level is just beating the wrong horse . part of being a teen is experimenting , and testing the waters . it \\' s not whining about how awful parents are , and purposely feeling dispondent . this is what the characters in this film do , and the film wants to show how they \\' re these great people who are being punished by the world because they \\' re teenagers , and how they try to defend themselves but can \\' t totally overcome them . it \\' s not their fault they kill people ; it \\' s the world \\' s ! what they really need is a reality check . the world is a bad place , and teenagers can be easily harmed because they are experimenting . but part of it is taking everything that happens to you and learning from it . the film thinks that teenagers are basically doomed , and there \\' s nothing they can do about it . hence the title . not only does it have bad fallacy , but it can \\' t even express this in an intelligent and coherent manner . everything \\' s overly surreal , and all we get are scenes of graphic violence and graphic sex . how does xavier licking semen off his hand express teen angst ? how does a talking decapitated head show that teens are dispondent because the world makes them this way ? and why does the film constantly go back to the teen angst issue of the film ? if araki had any kind of competence in writing or direction , he \\' d show them for what they really are . and if he didn \\' t want the satirical approach , he \\' d show the real problems with the world . and if you still don \\' t think that \" the doom generation \" is incompetent on every single possible level it could be , take the acting . rose macgowan is horrible . yes , she proved herself talented in \" scream , \" but she \\' s so bad in \" the doom generation \" that if i had not seen her in \" scream , \" i would have christened her one of the worst actresses working in films today . her entire performance is one - note ( bitchy ) , and the one scene where she cries over a dead animal is so forced that it \\' s laughable . equally bad is jonathan schaech , who wants to be the slacker serial killer : someone who doesn \\' t have any remorse because emotions cause some kind of strain . his performance is annoying as hell , and granted , he was better in \" that thing you do ! \" and then there \\' s james duval . let \\' s just say he makes keanu reeves look like brando . he has the same kind of slacker stuttering , only much much much worse , and every line he says is so bad that i have now deemed him \" least talented actor in the world . \" i have seen lots of bad actors , but james duval has got to be the worst . or at least somewhere up there . here \\' s another example of a bad scene , if you \\' re still not convinced : the film opens up in a club where they \\' re playing nine inch nail \\' s most banal song , \" heresy \" ( example of the lines : \" god is dead / and no one cares / if there is a hell / i \\' ll see you there \" ) , and as the song plays , and red strobe lights show the patrons dancing , the film pans over to amy , just standing there , looking dispondent . the film closes in on her , she looks right at the camera and says \" fuck . \" no explanation of this should be necessary . and finally , a note to gregg : grow up . really . move out of your parent \\' s basement , read something other than salinger , and get a day job . and don \\' t quit it .',\n",

       " (\"martin scorsese ' s kundun , which chronicles roughly the first twenty years of the life of the currently exiled dalai lama , has been criticized for its lack of narrative structure . personally , i don ' t think it needs one : it works perfectly well as a study of tibetan buddhist culture and how communist china . scorsese views the dalai lama the way many tibetans probably do , as a larger - than - life symbol of buddhist spirituality and political leadership : the only glimpses into his head come from several interesting yet oblique dream sequences , but his portrayal is appropriate for a film that concentrates on the political and spiritual rather than the personal . the set design and cinematography are outstanding , and while scorsese occasionally seems to get carried away with the spectacle , it helps to augment the cultural contrast when the dalai lama travels to china to meet chairman mao . political art sometimes succumbs to the temptation to start shouting slogans , kundun does not : it succeeds in delivering its message in an artistically interesting way and without being overly manipulative .\",\n",

       " ('here \\' s a word analogy : amistad is to the lost world as schindler \\' s list is to jurassic park . in 1993 , after steven spielberg made the monster dino hit , many critics described schindler \\' s list as the director \\' s \" penance \" ( as if there was a need for him to apologize for making a crowd - pleasing blockbuster ) . now , after a three - year layoff , spielberg is back with a vengeance . once again , his summer release was special effects - loaded action / adventure flick with dinosaurs munching on human appetizers . now , following his 1993 pattern , he has fashioned another serious , inspirational christmas release about the nature of humanity . that film is amistad . although not as masterful as schindler \\' s list , amistad is nevertheless a gripping motion picture . thematically rich , impeccably crafted , and intellectually stimulating , the only area where this movie falls a little short is in its emotional impact . watching schindler \\' s list was a powerful , almost spiritual , experience . spielberg pulled us into the narrative , absorbed us in the drama , then finally let us go , exhausted and shattered , three - plus hours later . aspects of the movie have stayed with me ever since . amistad , while a fine example of film making , is not as transcendent . the incident of the ship la amistad is not found in any history books , but , considering who writes the texts , that \\' s not a surprise . however , the event is a part of the american social and legal fabric , and , while amistad does not adhere rigorously to the actual account , most of the basic facts are in order . several , mostly minor changes have been made to enhance the film \\' s dramatic force . on the whole , while amistad may not be faithful to all of the details of the situation , it is true to the spirit and meaning of what transpired . one stormy night during the summer of 1839 , the 53 men imprisoned on the spanish slave ship la amistad escape . led by the lion - hearted cinque ( djimon hounsou ) , they take control of the vessel , killing most of the crew . adrift somewhere off the coast of cuba and uncertain how to make their way back to africa , they rely on the two surviving spaniards to navigate the eastward journey . they are tricked , however , and the la amistad , which makes its way northward off the united states \\' eastern coastline , is eventually captured by an american naval ship near connecticut . the kidnapped africans are shackled and thrown into prison , charged with murder and piracy . the first men to come to the africans \\' defense are abolitionists theodore joadson ( morgan freeman ) and lewis tappan ( stellan skarsgard ) . they are soon joined by roger baldwin ( matthew mcconaughey ) , a property attorney of little repute . aided by advice from former president john quincy adams ( anthony hopkins ) , baldwin proves a more persuasive orator than anyone gave him credit for , and his central argument -- that the prisoners were illegally kidnapped free men , not property -- convinces the judge . but powerful forces have aligned against baldwin \\' s cause . current president martin van buren ( nigel hawthorne ) , eager to please southern voters and 11 - year old queen isabella of spain ( anna paquin ) , begins pulling strings behind - the - scenes to ensure that none of the africans goes free . at its heart , amistad is a tale of human courage . cinque is a heroic figure whose spirit remains unbreakable regardless of the pain and indignity he is subjected to . he is a free man , not a slave , and , while he recognizes that he may die as a result of his struggle , he will not give it up . effectively portrayed by newcomer djimon hounsou , whose passion and screen presence arrest our attention , cinque is the key to viewers seeing the amistad africans as more than symbols in a battle of ideologies . they are individuals , and our ability to make that distinction is crucial to the movie \\' s success . to amplify this point , spielberg presents many scenes from the africans \\' point - of - view , detailing their occasionally - humorous observations about some of the white man \\' s seemingly - strange \" rituals \" . the larger struggle is , of course , one of defining humanity . as the nazis felt justified in slaughtering jews because they viewed their victims as \" sub - human , \" so the pro - slavery forces of amistad use a similar defense . the abolitionists regard the africans as men , but the slavers and their supporters see them as animals or property . in a sense , the morality of slavery is on trial here with the specter of civil war , which would break out less than three decades later , looming over everything . amistad \\' s presentation of the legal and political intricacies surrounding the trial are fascinating , making this movie one of the most engrossing courtroom dramas in recent history . four claimants come forward against the africans : the state , which wants them tried for murder ; the queen of spain , who wants them handed over to her under the provision of an american / spanish treaty ; two american naval officers , who claim the right of high seas salvage ; and the two surviving spaniards from la amistad , who demand that their property be returned to them . baldwin must counter all of these claims , while facing a challenge to his own preconceived notions as the result of a relationship he develops with cinque . even though attorney and client are divided by a language barrier , they gradually learn to communicate . aside from cinque , who is a fully - realized individual , characterization is spotty , but the acting is top - notch . matthew mcconaughey successfully overcomes his \" pretty boy \" image to become baldwin , but the lawyer is never particularly well - defined outside of his role in the la amistad case . likewise , while morgan freeman and stellan skarsgard are effective as joadson and tappan , they are never anything more than \" abolitionists . \" nigel hawthorne , who played the title character in the madness of king george , presents martin van buren as a spineless sycophant to whom justice means far less than winning an election . finally , there \\' s anthony hopkins , whose towering portrayal of john quincy adams is as compelling as anything the great actor has recently done . hopkins , who can convincingly play such diverse figures as a serial killer , an emotionally - crippled english butler , and richard nixon , makes us believe that he is adams . his ten - minute speech about freedom and human values is unforgettable . one point of difference worth noting between amistad and schindler \\' s list is this film \\' s lack of a well - defined human villain . schindler \\' s list had ralph fiennes \\' superbly - realized amon goeth , who was not only a three - dimensional character , but a personification of all that the nazis stood for . there is no such figure in amistad . the villain is slavery , but an ideology , no matter how evil , is rarely the best adversary . it is to spielberg \\' s credit that he has fashioned such a compelling motion picture without a prominent antagonist . amistad \\' s trek to the screen , which encountered some choppy waters ( author barbara chase - riboud has cried plagiarism , a charge denied by the film makers ) , comes in the midst of an upsurge of interest in the incident . an opera of the same name opened in chicago on november 29 , 1997 . numerous books about the subject are showing up on bookstore shelves . it remains to be seen how much longevity the amistad phenomena has , but one thing is certain -- with spielberg \\' s rousing , substantive film leading the way , the spotlight has now illuminated this chapter of american history .',\n",

       " ('this is a stagy film adapted from roger rueff \\' s play \" hospitality suite . \\'\\' its about three travelling salesmen attending an industrial convention , whose chicago company has sent them to wichita , where the company has paid all their expenses for them to rent a hospitality suite on the 16th floor of the hotel , where they aim to score a substantial account from the big kahuna , someone named dick fuller , who is the head of a big industrial corporation . he is someone they have never met before , but they want to sell him industrial lubricants and they want desperately to land this new account , it is their only reason for coming to the convention . \" the big kahuna \" revels in salesmen - talk among the three white christian males , two of them , larry ( spacey ) and phil ( devito ) , who are veteran salesmen , having teamed together for the last twelve years , while bob ( facinelli ) is a young man who has just recently been hired by the firm and works in the research department . these three are virtually imprisoned in their small hospitality suite waiting to meet the big kahuna , as the focus of this claustrophobic film is on their interactions in the hospitality suite . the three salesmen have different things on their mind that is troubling them and a different attitude to their job , and they are each going through internal changes that are profoundly altering their life . the outstanding cast tries to figure out in their own way what they are doing and why . what comes into question is their opinions on life and death , on god and morality , and on how they make a living . these are tough questions and the truth seems to be somewhere in their sales pitch . their dialogue is acerbic , witty , and analytical . following in the long tradition of salesmen films -- from death of a salesman , the tin men , and glengarry glen ross , as this film tries to get you to see what there is about salesmanship that gets these men high . in this case , it is landing the big kahuna . they each are trying to see why he \\' s on top and why they are chasing after him . what makes this film different than the others , is its blatant religious message , comparing orthodox religion to what they do , as both must sell their product . and how after each one \\' s psyche is stripped clean by the other , there is a pause and some lesson about life has sunk in that is pertinent to each . the goal in the movie is not in literally landing the big kahuna , but in finding out what bill of goods they sold themselves that made them be salesmen . larry and phil have one way of doing things and have no qualms of incorporating a sales pitch as part of their life . bob thinks he is above the fray and he pitches every chance he can get about his belief in jesus christ . his vacuous character and smug outlook on life are covered by a disarming smile and an eagerness for him to prove in his actions the words of jesus he literally believes in . bob is a baptist , who takes a very non - questioning and literal attitude about religion . to just look at another woman and lust after her is a sin , according to the way he reads the bible . when asked by larry why he married his wife , he seems puzzled and can \\' t even say because he loves her , only that marriage is something sacred to him . the contrast in their personalities is stark . larry is all business , he simply wants to close the sale . he comes into the room pumped for the convention , using his attack mode to establish how serious he is about being a salesman . he criticizes phil for being so placid , for getting such a small suite , for having the cheap food tray of carrot sticks rather than the one of stuffed shrimp , and for being burned - out . he tells him to go on a vacation . get a woman . while phil is reflective on where all his best years have gone for him and is contemplating a career change , now that he is 52 and is painfully divorcing his wife , after having lived too lonely a life on the road for too long . he now finds himself suffering from some troubling dreams and questioning what he believes in . he has always been a charmer , shaking everyone \\' s hand , trying to please his clients while trying to make the sale . larry is more aggressive as a salesman , he is always a heart attack away from every big sale . in contrast , bob is only in his twenties and everything seems fresh to him . this is his first time for him on the road . when dick fuller doesn \\' t arrive at the party the salesmen throw , larry becomes confrontational and asks phil if he spoke to the man himself about the gathering . when told that he spoke to the secretary , larry throws a tantrum and is resigned to going back to their home office without the new account . but when they start talking to bob , whom they forced to act as the bartender , they are surprised to learn that fuller did indeed come but was wearing another man \\' s name tag and that bob spent the entire evening consoling the tycoon over his recently deceased dog and then talking to him about jesus . bob then tells the boys about a private party fuller is attending afterwards , and that he invited bob to attend . larry and phil can \\' t fathom how bob didn \\' t make a sales pitch . but they soon take another tact and decide to prep bob on how to get fuller \\' s attention about their company \\' s product as they sent him off to meet fuller , and will await his return in the hotel room . these two sharp salesmen are reduced to waiting for this smug kid to come back and tell them he saved their ass . the irony of their situation is played out in the darkness of the hotel room , as they stay up late into the night trying to make sense out of their lives . these three performers were outstanding , each understanding what their role called for , each coming through with a marvelous performance . the only problem with the film , is that its more of a play than a cinematic experience . but the insightful dialogue and refreshing dramatics , give it an intelligent selling point and make it a good product to see .',\n",

       " ('with more and more television shows having gay characters , and even the infamous \" ellen \" sitcom being centered on the life of a lesbian , the movie industry too seems to be gaining more and more homosexual based plot lines . the birdcage was critically acclaimed , as was this years chasing amy . then along came in & out , and all three of these films are on my top ten list for the years in which they were released . it \\' s also noticeable that this \" alternative lifestyle \" becomes less and less taboo as the years go by , and it seems that using comedy as a medium is proving a worthwhile effort . while it \\' s a very serious issue to many , it is the comedies that people are flocking to see and that are gaining notoriety . but the way we \\' re using comedy to present homosexuality is also changing quite dramatically . while the gay community was once very stereotyped and used to laugh * at * , it is more and more becoming something we laugh * with * , and when a movie like in & out comes along , it is something that both heterosexuals and homosexuals should be able to thoroughly enjoy . it doesn \\' t poke fun at the lifestyle , it simply uses it to all it \\' s comedic capacity , just as love , sex , marriage , birth , death , and anything else has been . the idea for in & out was born the day tom hanks won his oscar for portraying an aids - afflicted gay man in philadelphia . if you remember , during his acceptance speech , hanks gave a highly emotional tribute to the gay community , and even sighted a former gay teacher of his as a major inspiration in his life . it \\' s a serious and touchy subject , but producer scott rudin viewed it as the setting for a potentially hilarious comedy , and pitched it to screenwriter paul rudnick . it \\' s true that if this same film had been written by a heterosexual , it may have been more controversial , but because it was written by an openly gay writer , the prerogative was set . kevin kline , who only seems to become more and more acclaimed , stars as howard brackett , a high school english teacher in the small , picturesque town of greenleaf , indiana . after a three - year engagement to fellow teacher emily montgomery ( joan cusack ) , a wedding date has been set , and the hubbub surrounding it is almost as big as that surrounding another huge story - greenleaf high graduate cameron drake ( matt dillon ) is up for a best actor oscar . the small town eagerly awaits both events , and both seem quite astronomical , but little does anyone know how much one will affect the other . when cameron drake is announced the winner , the excitement is heightened as he pays tribute to his high school english teacher , mr . brackett . everyone is cheering back in greenleaf - that is until cameron tacks on those three calamitous words , \" and he \\' s gay . \" the town becomes silent as the entire population joins in a simultaneous jaw drop . the thing is , nobody , including howard , can understand how cameron came to that conclusion , and such wild and unexpected news can only wreak havoc in such a conservative american haven such as greenleaf . naturally the questions pour from howard \\' s fiancee , parents ( debbie reynolds & wilford brimley ) , students , and the high school \\' s principal , tom halliwell ( bob newhart ) , and the evidence starts to become more and more obvious : howard is clean , neat , honest , sincere , a romantic , and perhaps the most incriminating fact , he loves barbara streisand . the frenzy isn \\' t helped any when camera crews from every conceivable news magazine and \" entertainment tonight \" wannabe show up at greenleaf high the very next morning . one particular reporter is peter malloy ( tom selleck ) of \" inside entertainment \" , who unlike the collage of other reporters , wants to spend a whole week in the life of howard brackett , including coverage of his wedding . the intrusion is all but welcome by howard , who is going more and more out of his mind with each passing minute . it seems that no matter where he turns , a camera is being shoved in his face and questions regarding homosexuality are being tossed to him like frisbees . the dominoes begin to tumble as howard \\' s closest friends begin acting different and principal halliwell hints at a possible termination of employment should howard indeed be gay . it all sounds very devastating , and it would be if it weren \\' t presented with near - perfection by one of this year \\' s most delightful ensemble casts . kline seems only to improve with age , and he is downright perfect here . the great thing about this film is that every single character has a moment to shine , and they use it wonderfully . every single actor turns in one of their best performances ever . dillon has never been so likeable , cusack has never seemed so perfect for a role , and brimley , reynolds , and newhart all provide huge laughs when they \\' re up to bat . rudnick \\' s script is heavily laced with wit and humor , and you \\' ll likely find yourself laughing out loud for a solid ninety minutes . while in & out doesn \\' t carry enough to give it four stars , it remains one of the best done films of the year , all - around . the script is exuberant , the actors are absolutely top - notch , and we \\' re allowed just the perfect blend of heart - tugging so as not to bog down the laughs . it remains a solid comedy throughout its entirety , yet we \\' re still allowed a sappily touching ending . despite it \\' s subject matter , and one scene that comes almost too close for comfort on explaining gay sex , this is a movie that everyone could , and should , enjoy . frank oz , best known as a voice talent for muppets , directs this film quite delightfully , using all the potential rudnick \\' s script has to offer , which turns out to be quite a bit . check this one out . you \\' ll have a gay old time .',\n",

( think charlie and irene will fall in love ? yeah , me too . ) the farrellys then introduce scores of different characters , and none of them ever manage to do anything you haven \\' t already expected them to do , no matter how outrageous their actions might be . compared to the curveballs the farrellys are used to throwing , this stuff is almost entirely soft - tossed , presenting an obvious problem : when gross - out humor loses its shock value , it \\' s no longer funny , merely gross . the jokes that do work are milked over and over until their effectiveness runs dry . take , for example , the subplot involving charlie \\' s three black sons ( anthony anderson , mongo brownlee , jerod mixon ) . the incongruity of it all is funny for a while , with three burly black men discussing higher math in ghetto language and white - bread carrey mouthing said language with an entirely too - pleasant smile on his face . but by the end of the film , they \\' re still doing the same schitck it hasn \\' t been elevated to another , funnier level , and it hasn \\' t been dropped either . that \\' s too bad , because it ceases to be amusing about halfway through . \" me , myself & irene \" reeks of wasted opportunities . there ought to be more focus on how other people react to charlie \\' s new personality , and on how charlie deals with the consequences of hank \\' s actions . this doesn \\' t really happen nearly every supporting character learns about charlie \\' s condition early on , so they don \\' t have any opportunity to be surprised by it . the film throws what looks like a patented farrelly curve in a scene towards the midway point ( involving an albino companion charlie and irene pick up called , appropriately , \" whitey \" ) , but the script doesn \\' t go anywhere with it , instead leaving the thread twisting in the wind before awkwardly tying it up during the climax . jim carrey is a gifted comedian , both physically and vocally , but he \\' s left with nothing much to do here except contort himself in a manner similar to steve martin in \" all of me . \" it \\' s a great showcase of flexibility and split - second role - shifting , but none of it is terribly funny . carrey doesn \\' t pull any stunts we don \\' t expect him to pull , and the farrellys \\' script doesn \\' t give him anything else to pull : the situations in which he must perform the role - shifting aren \\' t set up in any meaningful way . perhaps carrey can take solace in the fact that his supporting actors fare no better . zellweger \\' s irene is not a strong female lead mary in \" mary \" may have been part adolescent fantasy , but she was also intelligent and strong - willed . irene is nothing in particular , as the film never makes clear whether she \\' s ditzy , clever , or neither . as such , she gives us nothing to latch onto as the only \" sane \" person in the film . chris cooper is stuck playing exactly one note as a corrupt fbi agent , and his character is entirely too straight - laced for a movie like this . he , like the others , does absolutely nothing unexpected . after viewing the shapeless mess that \" me , myself & irene \" eventually dissolved into , i was stuck wondering whether or not the farrellys had outsmarted themselves . maybe their kind of comedy can only work for so long until audiences get wise to it and stop being shocked . but i don \\' t believe it -- good filmmakers find ways of surprising their audiences even after people have grown attuned to their style . if the farrellys are indeed good , smart filmmakers ( and i still think they are ) , they \\' ll rebound just fine . even after that happens , though , i \\' ll still consider \" me , myself & irene \" to be a high - caliber misfire .',\n",

       " ('ralph fiennes is carving out a nice niche for himself in the genre of period piece romances . for his followup to the academy - beloved the english patient , he has once again turned to a love story , this time directed by accomplished australian film maker gillian armstrong ( little women ) . despite some obvious overplotting , oscar and lucinda is a mostly effective and often affecting motion picture that touches our hearts while daring our minds to balk at its implausible coincidences . the film opens in the mid - 1800s , with parallel storylines in new south wales , australia and devon , england . as the helpful narrative voice of geoffrey rush informs us , lucinda leplastrier ( cate blanchett ) is a headstrong young woman being raised in the australian outback . meanwhile , half the world away , oscar hopkins ( fiennes ) has broken with his puritanical father over religious issues , and has gone away to school to study to be an anglican priest . lucinda is fascinated with glass ; oscar is obsessed with theology . lucinda is rich ; oscar is poor . lucinda is forward and self - assured ; oscar is timid and uncertain of himself . yet one characteristic unites these two diverse individuals -- the compulsion to gamble , whether it \\' s on horses , dogs , cards , or the flip of a coin . and fate has decreed that they will one day meet . that day doesn \\' t occur until 45 minutes into the film , when oscar boards a ship bound for sidney , australia , where he hopes to change his life and minister to anyone in need of his help . another of the passengers is lucinda , who is returning from england where she was shopping for machinery to equip her newly - acquired glassworks factory . at first , their relationship is that of a reverend and a confessor , but it doesn \\' t take long for both of them to recognize a kindred spirit in the other . a friendship is born , and , once they reach australia , it develops into something more potent . but oscar is uncertain of lucinda \\' s affection , and feels he must do something to prove himself worthy of her . oscar and lucinda isn \\' t beyond a little manipulation to get the desired emotional response , and there are times when the storyline curves in preposterous directions . on more than one occasion , it \\' s apparent that events are occurring specifically to funnel the characters into a position where there is only one possible route . coincidence is a crucial plot device ; without it , this movie can \\' t go anywhere . the voiceover narration ( never one of my favorite techniques ) is too verbose and breaks into the story at undesirable moments . ( however , without it , the final twist , which i will not reveal , would not be as poignant . ) yet , despite these quibbles , i enjoyed oscar and lucinda . storyline faults pale in the light of two such finely - realized characters . thematically , the film is also strong . the unifying motif -- that everything in life is a gamble -- is successfully delineated . oscar and lucinda don \\' t just wager their money , they bet their hearts , minds , and souls . a card game they engage in shortly after they first meet could easily be considered a form of emotional \" strip poker \" where defenses are peeled away to reveal their shared , secret passion . oscar does not see gambling as a vice . in fact , he believes that the greatest chance one takes in life is betting one \\' s immortal soul on the truth of a religious faith . ralph fiennes , who normally plays strong , confident men , is very much at home as the fumbling , insecure oscar . the actor brings a variety of nervous tics to the part , all of which subtly add to a vague sense of discomfort whenever oscar is on - screen . as good as fiennes is , however , he is eclipsed by cate blanchett . the actress , who appeared earlier this year as one of the leads in bruce beresford \\' s paradise road , is mesmerizing as lucinda . she gives this liberated woman her flash , and feeds the chemistry between the two lead characters so that it sparkles rather than fizzles . effective support is provided by ciaran hinds ( the male lead in jane austen \\' s persuasion ) as lucinda \\' s close friend , tom wilkinson ( the full monty ) as oscar \\' s mentor , and clive russell as a self - serving adventurer . there \\' s a real magic in the way armstrong develops the story , keeping things moving in unexpected directions without lingering too long on any one moment or sequence . ( in fact , i wish she had devoted a little more time to the luminous middle act , which has oscar and lucinda together . ) with the skill of a consummate storyteller , she weaves romance , friendship , passion , humor , and tragedy together into a complete package . the characters , with all of their human foibles and neuroses , are wonderfully developed by fiennes and blanchett . so who cares if the storyline is a little ripe and unwieldy ? oscar and lucinda still offers abundant pleasures to reward the viewer .',\n",

only to see her get kidnapped by dragonlike gwythants . taran chases after the gwythants and finds himself staring at the horned king \\' s castle from far away . taran climbs the castle walls , and brings himself into the castle , where he attempts to rescue hen wen . he manages to do so , but he is himself captured and thrown into the dungeon . there , he meets princess eilonwy ( and her magic bauble , another thing which the horned king was hoping to use to find the cauldron ) , and the two escape through the deep castle walls . along the way , taran finds a sword in a burial chamber , and they rescue a comic bard named fflewdurr flamm , who has a harp whose strings break whenever he tells a lie . the three manage to escape the horned king \\' s castle , but not before taran realizes that his sword is magic . as they rest in the forest , gurgi reappears , claiming to have found hen wen \\' s trail . he leads taran , eilonwy and fflewdurr , by way of ` pig tracks \\' , to a whirlpool . suddenly , they all get sucked under , and they meet the fairy - like fairfolk . taran is reunited with hen wen , and informed that the black cauldron is hidden in the land of morva . he then devises a crazy idea that if they can destroy the cauldron , it would prevent the horned king from destroying their world . with the help of a grumpy fairy named doli , the four travelers manage to find themselves at a mysterious cottage . it turns out to be no ordinary cottage ; three comically strange witches inhabit the place . when taran tells them that they are searching for the black cauldron , they agree to let him have it ? in exchange for his sword . taran agrees , much to eilonwy \\' s horror , but at least they get the black cauldron . but ? the cauldron can \\' t be destroyed , only its evil powers can be stopped . the only way to do so is for a living being to climb into it of his own free will ? never to return alive . things take a turn for the worse when the horned king \\' s henchmen capture taran , eilonwy , and fflewdurr , along with the black cauldron , and lead them back to the castle . taran , eilonwy , and fflewdurr watch in horror as the horned king unleashes the supernatural powers of the cauldron to ressurect his army of deathless warriors ( this is the most horrifying scene in the film , because here , a dead army comes alive ? ) . just when all seems lost , though , gurgi reappears , and rescues taran , eilonwy , and fflewdurr . taran is about to jump into the black cauldron , but gurgi stops him , not wanting him to throw his life away . gurgi then jumps into the black cauldron , and the deathless warriors decay . taran tries to find a way to rescue gurgi , but he is forced to do battle against the horned king . he kicks the horned king away , who is then magically sucked into the black cauldron , where its powers immediately destroy him completely . taran , eilonwy , and fflewdurr manage to escape from the horned king \\' s castle just as it self - destructs . the witches then reappear and attempt to take the now useless black cauldron away , but fflewdurr stops them , saying that they ` never give anything away , they bargain \\' . in response to this , the witches offer taran his sword back , but taran instead has a new trade : the cauldron for gurgi . the trade is made ; gurgi \\' s seemingly lifeless body reappears before the heartbroken group . as taran cradles him in his arms , though , gurgi stirs - he is not dead after all ! the happy group then returns home , where hen wen ( brought home by the fairfolk once the dangers are past ) , dallben , and even doli , await their triumphant return . as spectacular as it sounds , the black cauldron really suffered a lot in its past times . before ron miller was fired from his position as chairman of walt disney productions , he had bought a novel by lloyd alexander called the black cauldron , a sword and sorcery tale for the studio . bringing this book to the screen was the studio \\' s fondest dream . miller , who entitled himself as the executive producer , promised that they would do so after they had proved themselves on other projects . when micheal eisner and his executives arrived at the disney animation studio , the animators were struggling to complete the black cauldron . by this time , things had gone really rocky for the animation department . many of the studio \\' s old men had retired or died . therefore , the animators suffered a hard time making this film . originally budgeted at $ 25 million , the costs raised to $ 40 million because of constant changes on everything ? and when it was finally released on june 24 , 1985 , the black cauldron was greeted by praising reviews from some critics , but somehow the film flopped . the film was rated pg and the film , although ` disneyfied \\' from lloyd alexander \\' s chronicles of prydain ( which is what this film is based on ) , was much more scarier and darker than disney \\' s other previous efforts , such as the rescuers and the fox and the hound , which is probably why so many people considered it too scary and stayed away from it . in addition , other critics rejected it for having ` no heart \\' and ` unmemorable \\' , compared to other disney animated features . but whatever the real reason , the black cauldron was a financial disaster , grossing only $ 21 million . the failure of the film grounded the studio \\' s animation department , and exiled the animation team to annex buildings in nearby glendale , and it seemed like animated features would no longer become a part of the studio \\' s reputation . the next two disney animated features , the great mouse detective and oliver and company , although a little more lighthearted than the black cauldron , didn \\' t do much better ( although oliver and company grossed much more than the black cauldron and the great mouse detective ) . only with the little mermaid did the studio regain its reputation for successful animated features . as for the black cauldron , it was rereleased in some cities for a temporary time under the title taran and the magic cauldron . finally , the studio locked the film in the film vault and denied that it ever even was released . because of all this , you might ask yourself , was the black cauldron really such a bad movie ? the people who had seen the film didn \\' t think so . in fact , many people had calls to buena vista home video requesting for the film , but of course , they denied it . for a while , it seemed like the black cauldron would never be released to video ? until september 1997 , disney released the black cauldron to video in the united kingdom . few people imported the video from england and converted to ntsc ( including me ) and for those who hadn \\' t seen the film yet ( i am included here ) , they got quite a treat . but people who had bootleg copies of the black cauldron noticed that in the scene where the horned king raises his army of deathless warriors , about 12 seconds of ghoulish looking skeletons were slightly trimmed so that the film would get a u rating ( in the uk , the u rating means universal : suitable for all ages , kinda like their own version of g ) . somewhere online , a team of diehard the black cauldron fans signed a petition that said , ` bring back the black cauldron ! \\' , and because of that , disney finally decided to release the video to the united states . before that time , rumors online had been made that the video would be trimmed , like the uk video , so that it would get a g rating , and that they would add in songs . those rumors were put to rest when the walt disney company announced that the black cauldron * would * be released in its pg rated version . even still , when it was finally released to the us , some reaction was mixed . some felt that it was indeed cut , but some felt that it wasn \\' t . but these where only minor criticisms which seemed laughable , since a film that was absent for thirteen years was finally available . as for myself , when i saw the movie for the first time ( on converted ntsc video ) , i didn \\' t expect much at all . in fact , i had heard so many mediocre things about it , that i didn \\' t think the film would ever be such a good film . much to my surprise , when i saw the first few minutes of the film , i was asking myself , \" this is the same film everyone saw ? the one that flopped at the box office ? the one that critics and filmgoers alike called \" a bad movie \" ? this doesn \\' t seem like all of the above . instead , it \\' s a classic in its own right . the film has a wonderful cast of characters . there \\' s taran ( grant bardsley ) , an assistant pig keeper who would rather be a warrior than a pig - keeper , the story \\' s hero . the critics have said that taran is not likeable at all , but the opposite is true . he is brave , loyal , and eventually learns a lesson about friendship later on . there \\' s a likeable character here ! not that he \\' s the only likeable character in the film . there \\' s gurgi ( john biner ) , a lovable little , uh , thing who remains loyal to taran , even though they don \\' t quite hit it off at first . but another likeable character is the bad guy comic henchman , a dwarf named creeper ( phil fondacairo ) , who is loyal to the film \\' s imaginative and sinister villain , the horned king ( voiced gruesomely by john hurt ) , yet he also fears his neck . the other characters , including the sidekicks , a spunky , but sweet princess named eilonwy and the comic bard fflewdurr flamm , and three comically wicked witches who hide a dark secret , although pleasant and likeable , aren \\' t quite as well rounded as they should be . the story itself is an adventurous one , a quest involving the mystical pig , hen wen , the black cauldron itself , and an army of deathless ones with everything : a hooking opening to a spectacular finale . elmer bernstein \\' s music also tells the story perfectly , in a dark , yet calming manner . the animation itself is surprisingly good considering that this film was created in the darkest time of the studios . even though there are some occasional effects that are not quite good , like the ground opening when the black cauldron rises out of the earth , the animation overall is top notch . overall ? this film is an entertaining endeavor . fans unfamiliar to the lloyd alexander chronicles of prydain will get a kick out of this one , except young kids . there are some extremely scary scenes which are more darker than disney \\' s other films ( although some consider the stampede sequence from the lion king and frollo observing esmeralda in the fires of hell in the hunchback of notre dame are just as scary ) , which is the main reason why this film is rated pg . fans familiar to the lloyd alexander series will recognize the differences between the novel and the movie . even though it doesn \\' t have all of the ingredients of a true disney film , this film is a classic in its own right , and deserves a far better chance than what it has been given . that better chance has finally come . whatever reason about why the black cauldron was such a big failure seems to have disappeared , and the film has finally achieved its place among disney \\' s most proudest achievements . i can \\' t help but think though , whatever would have happened if the black cauldron * was * a box office success ?',\n",

       " ('i \\' ve never been a huge fan of jeff bridges , but i loved him in the big lebowski . the part of jeff \" the dude \" lebowski was reportedly written specifically with bridges in mind , and the fit is perfect . the dude is an unemployed denizen of los angeles , a hippie slob on a bowling team with a soft spot for white russians . he \\' s enjoying a leisurely soak in the tub when two thugs break into his apartment demanding to be paid for the money his wife owes . after much pleading he convinces them they have the wrong guy , but not before they urinate on his rug . the dude assumes that these \" collection agents \" were after another jeff lebowski , a famous millionaire who also lives in l . a . so he goes to meet his namesake to ask for enough money to replace his rug . the millionaire refuses , but calls him back when he discovers his wife has been kidnaped . he wants the dude to act as go - between for the kidnapers . dude and his friend walter ( john goodman ) take on the task , and get caught in an intricate web of kidnapers , millionaires , high schoolers , nihilists , artists , pornographers , thugs , and league bowlers . comedy is perhaps the most subjective of genres , so take my recommendation as you will : for me , the big lebowski is very funny . it is an incredibly successful comedy , the ratio of laughs to intended jokes much higher than in most films . not only are the two leads ( bridges and goodman ) funny separately and together , but each supporting character is a refreshing comic figure . all the characters end up as the butt of jokes , but the jokes are always deserved and never contrived . each person may be a comic caricature , but there is always a respectful self - acceptance that lets us laugh at these people without condescension . the characters are firmly established , and they never change their behavior for a quick , cheap laugh . it \\' s not what they do that \\' s funny , it \\' s who they are , which is why the acting is so important , and so successful , in this movie . worth mentioning are john turturro as jesus ( that \\' s jee - zus , not hay - soos ) , the greaser bowler who \\' s in a lusty marriage with the game ; julianne moore as the post - post - feminist artist whose work has been described as \" vaginal ; \" steve buscemi as the eager tagalong bowler who is constantly rebuked and ignored by teammates dude and walter ; and sam elliott as the rambling , long - winded narrator . aside from the performances , what makes all the characters funny and interesting is the astute dialogue . people lose trains of thought , they interrupt , they boast , they repeat themselves , they repeat their friends . . . they sound natural . taken with fargo , the coen brothers \\' last film , it is evidence that the brothers are observant listeners and gifted writers . ethan coen is not just good at directing actors , he \\' s also good at technical directing . he and cinematographr roger deakins created a beautiful world on film . perhaps \" beautiful \" is the wrong word ; nihilists , carpet - pissers and thugs are not objects of beauty . but the bowling photography and a series of viking / bowling fantasy dream sequences are lovingly photographed , as though the dude himself were in charge of immortalizing them on film . all around , the big lebowski is great , solid comedy . outstanding acting , writing , direction and photography all combine to make this a great comic success .',\n",

       " (\"wild things is a suspenseful thriller starring matt dillon , denise richards , and neve campbell that deals with all the issues ; sex , love , murder , and betrayal . the setting of the film is a town named blue bay . it consists of many swamps and slums and , on the other hand , rich estates owned by the town ' s different benefactors . the film opens just before the beginning of a senior seminar at the town ' s ritzy , expensive high school . it is here that we meet all of the core characters . there ' s guidance counselor sam lombardo , police officers ray duquette and gloria perez , dark mysterious senior suzie toller , and the popular head cheerleader kelly van ryan . we first see that all of the senior girls are smitten with the handsome guidance counselor , but none more than kelly . throughout the first portion of the film we see how far kelly will go to get sam until she accuses him of rape . shortly after , suzie , too , confesses that sam raped her as well . this pushes kelly ' s sex craving mother , sandra , to stop at nothing until sam is convicted . during the trial , kelly gives a teary confession of how sam raped her . however , it is later revealed by suzie that sam never raped either of the girls , it was all a vengeful plan against the guidance counselor . after sam is cleared , kelly ' s mother pays sam a very substantial amount of cash in order for him not to sue her . it is then revealed that sam , kelly , and suzie were all in on it together . it is here that the film starts to reveal just who is being honest with each other and who has their own hidden agenda . matt dillon stars as sam lombardo . sam is the kind of guy that every woman would like to sink their claws into , and sam obviously knows it and uses it to his own advantage . he isn ' t the obvious best of actors , but dillon does give a convincing performance . however , his talents seem to be rendered useless near the end of the film , making it look as though his character has lost all of his ethics and principles , although he never had many to start out with in the first place . neve campbell , who most people relate to scream and scream 2 , plays blue bay outcast suzie toller . suzie obviously has some serious issues to deal with which are obvious from her first scene in the film . campbell is very successful with this character , adding the slightest bit of charm to a seemingly repulsive character and making her fun to watch . playing kelly van ryan is denise richards . kelly is your typical , rich , sexy , head cheerleader who thinks she can have any man she choses , like her sexpot mother sandra . one of the most interesting things about this film is how it compares and contrasts the relationship between kelly and her mother . denise richards , still hot off the press from starship troopers , gives the most interesting performance in the entire film . in the beginning , kelly looks to be a paper thin character , but richards adds a little more spice and ultimately makes the character not only sexy , but dominating as well . kevin bacon gives one of his fair performances as ray duquette . this character looks to be one of the most boring , predictable in the film . however , it is a relationship revealed between him and suzie that adds depth to his story . still , the film doesn ' t seem to gain much from bacon ' s performance , only his name . in the supporting cast , theresa russell plays the much oversexed sandra van ryan , daphne rubin - vega gives an unappealing performance as cop gloria perez , and bill murray shines as sam ' s lawyer , ken bowden . hats off to murray for adding the perfect touch of comedy to the film . although wild things was displayed by the press as being an erotic thriller , the eroticism , which is portrayed with good taste , is kept to a minimum and focuses more on the plot and the relationships between the characters . this is truly a very good film worth seeing if your looking for a movie with a thick plot filled with it ' s share of twists .\",\n",

( in one unintentionally ( ? ) hilarious sequence , nasa asks harry to inspect a deep - core driller they built based on his own blueprints ; it is poorly constructed - harry criticizes almost every aspect of it . we trust nasa to build space shuttles that can land on twirling asteroids ? ) harry assembles the obligatory \" ragtag \" bunch of \" cowboys \" , including a blond guy , a fat guy , a black guy , a wiseass , and the man who is sleeping with his daughter ( affleck ) . once they reach space , we experience sequence after sequence of something going wrong - perhaps the fact that they sent a bunch of nincompoops into outer space has something to do with it ; i cannot count the number of times they almost fail the mission on all my fingers and toes . whether or not they save the day , i will not reveal . nor will you care . i will say this : you know you \\' re in trouble when deep impact dwarfs your asteroid movie in terms of emotion and scope . willis has barely a chance to come alive ; ditto for affleck . their big scenes are mostly reserved for the third act , in a last minute - and futile - attempt to inject warmth into the material . steve buscemi \\' s character - the wiseass - is exceptionally problematic . \" rockhound \" , as he \\' s called , is sarcastic and foolish , so they tape him to a chair , where he spends most of the film . so why did they bring him up there to begin with ? rather , why write him into the film ? - give his almost - witty one - liners to serious willis , who scowls and mopes and demonstrates psychotic tendencies : at one point he chases after affleck with his shotgun for screwing his daughter , firing often and causing significant damage to his oil rig . i \\' m guessing he qualifies under nasa guidelines as someone unfit for space travel , at least in my world where the sky is blue . liv tyler is pretty and humourless , as always ; suspiciously , four of her father \\' s band \\' s ( \" aerosmith \" ) songs grace the soundtrack . director michael bay lays the visual and sound effects on thick , like ketchup , eventually drowning the movie on - screen . ( the middle hour is a non - sensical , pyrotechnic assault on the average primate \\' s brain . ) whenever someone dies in this movie , a crew member inevitably yells out \" we lost ( insert dead person \\' s last name here ) ! \" i must admit that not once could i distinguish a dead oil - guy - cum - astronaut from a live one , and close - ups of the corpses \\' faces beneath cracked helmets provided little assistance , as their skin was often covered in fake blood . armageddon is not as terrible movie as godzilla . it looks nicer , and has fewer plot - holes within its equally ludicrous framework . it has a vivid soundmix . but at almost two - and - a - half hours , i could not believe how little actually happened over the course of the story . the love story has been played up in the ads , perhaps hoping to catch people before they recover from titanic - fever . bollocks ! the lovers in the film are miles apart throughout - erase all thoughts of nude sketching or car - sex and replace them with obligatory shots of liv tyler tearing up while ben affleck dicks around in a moon - crawler . remember a little film called jaws ? in this film , three independent - minded men suddenly found themselves on a fishing boat in pursuit of a deadly shark . they didn \\' t much like each other at first ; eventually , they started to respect one another . one of jaws \\' great scenes involved the would - be - ahabs drinking and singing songs and telling stories . this is the sort of male - bonding foreign to bay or his producer , jerry bruckheimer , who throw too many characters into the mix and expect we \\' ll care about them on the grounds that the world is about to end . not once do we get the feeling that these characters are even acquaintances - i \\' d be surprised if these actors bothered to introduce themselves to one another before \" action \" was called . a male friend who loved the film suggested to me that perhaps i cannot relate to a bunch of men who don \\' t bare their souls , who believe in dying macho concepts like heroism and a kind of chest - beating bravery . to this , i will respond that the boys in armageddon are neither heroic , nor brave , nor smart , even : this team couldn \\' t build a birdhouse . and if i get no respect for disliking a movie with all the synthetic feeling of a trailer - a trailer for a movie written by a team of body - builders and greeting card authors - i \\' ve never been a prouder wimp my whole life .',\n",

) . i have to say here that i knew exactly what i was getting into going into this film . there \\' s not a frame of promotional footage i have seen for the film that would have led me to believe it was going to be any good . in this respect , the film never disappointed me . this film reaches a level that transcends the \" so bad it \\' s good \" level and borders on the downright insane . the effects are awful , the script is contrived , and for most of the feature i was laughing at things that were supposed to be taken seriously ( i think ) . i challenge anyone to sit through the scene , where a bat stalks a baby in a crib while another bat terrorizes a patron eating at a diner , with a straight face . thankfully , the performances are as good as they can be considering the material the actors had to perform with . dina meyer has always been the highlight of any of the films she has been in ( johnny mnemonic , dragonheart , and starship troopers . . . the latter being the only film out of that batch with any actual merit ) , and this one is no exception . while one never really gets the impression that meyer \\' s character could be a bat expert in reality , one never really cares to doubt it either . she gives as good a performance as could be expected , plus she \\' s nice to look at for an hour and a half . lou diamond phillips is also serviceable here , as the small town sheriff turned eventual hero . although when we first meet his character he knows bats are the reason for what \\' s going on in town , for some reason later on he suddenly becomes amazed to learn that the actual cause of the deaths in town are because of bats . the only bad performance in the film is that of leon \\' s . he is relegated to the \" i \\' m not sticking around here ! \" character and proceeds to repeat variations of that line for the majority of the film even though he stays . anyone who can \\' t immediately tell that bob gunton ( the bad guy in patch adams and countless other films ) is going to eventually turn on the gang and side with his creations before his eminent death will probably be surprised , but i highly doubt it . even if he hadn \\' t been the villain in just about every film he \\' s ever been in , so many obvious hints are given to indicate the devious act that it holds no shock whatsoever . in fact , his death is welcome , because it finally starts moving the plot towards the finale . if the plot doesn \\' t sound ridiculous to you yet , then check out these little tidbits : a multitude of bats inexplicably disperses when a police officer cocks his pistol . an entire town disregards the sheriff and doctor \\' s orders to stay indoors after a curfew is instigated , causing mass hysteria when the bats come out in full force , killing several townsfolk . a government official blows off shelia \\' s instructions ( to wait until dawn to install a cooling unit in the bats \\' cave that will kill all of them off ) by pulling a night job , resulting in the death of an entire military unit . a cavern full of bat feces never ignites when a phosphorus flare is lit right in the middle of it . finally , to top it all off , this little texas town is showing nosferatu in it \\' s single screen theater ( for reference , our town has over a million people in it with nearly 150 movie screens , and we \\' re lucky to even get kevin smith \\' s dogma ) . the most laughable part of the movie though comes from the ill - conceived bat puppets . while the actual bat attack scenes are shot with rapid fire editing ( making the scenes nearly impossible to comprehend what \\' s going on ) , the scenes where a bat is called upon to interact with a live actor are usually shot more low - key . therefore we the audience get loving close - ups of the most unrealistic , rubbery bat puppets ever committed to film . being able to see the puppeteer \\' s arms would be the only things that could have made these creations worse . after all of this , if you still decide bats might be the movie for you , don \\' t say you haven \\' t been warned . trust me when i say that it \\' s a lot more fun to trash than it is to sit through . i just wish that dina meyer would be cast in more roles or at least choose better films to appear in . she \\' s definitely a talent that is going to waste in films like these .',\n",

       " ('in intolerance , d . w . griffith told four different historical stories at the same time , cutting from one to the other . each of the stories builds to a fast - paced climax . in magnolia , paul thomas anderson tells several stories each just tangentially connected to the others . yet the stories and where they are going are all independent . what is strange about these stories is that they are all synchronized . each story builds to a tense moment ( or what appears to be intended to be a tense moment ) but then lets the tension dissolve . while the tension dissipates one character starts singing a song and in each plotline the major characters sing along , even though they are not in the same scene . then toward the end the stories each build to a tense moment again . it is almost as if the characters are somehow psychically linked . this creates some strange effects . the stories are about empty desperate people with dysfunctional relationships . the strands have varying degrees of bizarre content . we have the story of a dying man earl partridge ( jason robards ) wanting to get in touch with his son and make amends . phil parma ( philip seymour hoffman ) is his nurse who is frantic to help partridge achieve his final goal . partridge \\' s young wife linda ( julianne moore ) is getting more and more anxious as partridge dies , but for an unsuspected reason . frank mackey ( tom cruise ) runs the kinds of self - help seminar that businesses like so much , but he aims his at teaching disaffected men how to be real shit - heels in dealing with women in an angry backlash to women \\' s lib . officer jim kurring ( john c . reilly ) is a patrolman who has a need to feel he is making the world a better place . jimmy gator ( philip baker hall ) hosts a popular children \\' s tv quiz show that really exploits and destroys children as we see from the stories of current quiz kid stanley spector ( jeremy blackman ) and former quiz kid donnie smith ( william h . macy ) . the film juggles all these stories for over three hours , but even after all this time not one story is resolved satisfactorily . each story moves toward a single bizarre common climax , but it is not one that seems to do much but derail each story . the common climax itself is ambiguous in many ways and it fails to really tie up any of the stories . the film seems to be built around strange events and weird history , but it really has little to do with the content of the stories , though they all are connected in part by one weird event . magnolia will probably bring some much deserved attention to paul thomas anderson , though in my opinion his two previous films , hard eight and boogie nights were better told stories . it is interesting that one starts to look forward to actors from anderson \\' s company . john c . reilly seems to be a standard fixture . particularly notable is philip baker hall who gave a mesmerizing performance from the first scene of hard eight . here he several of the characters are mesmerizing , but that characteristic is not really used . as studies of characters these stories are each worth following . as well - rounded stories with a beginning , middle and end , they leave something to be desired . but the film is willing to do the unexpected and that helps make the film worth sitting through . i rate it a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low + 2 on the - 4 to + 4 scale . heavy spoiler . . . heavy spoiler . . . heavy spoiler . . . heavy spoiler . . . during the strange climactic event of the film we get multiple messages from the filmmaker that the event we are seeing really does happen . and in actual fact , it does . since biblical times rains of frogs have been interpreted as signs of displeasure of the gods . it is , however , a perfectly natural , if somewhat unnerving , phenomenon . the cause is associated with whirlwinds . we know that tornadoes over land can rip up land and even objects of some size from the ground and hurl them into the air , holding them aloft . the reader may remember the unfortunate cow in twister . smaller objects can be hurled high into the atmosphere and then be kept aloft by the updrafts for surprisingly long periods of time much as hail and chunks of ice are . when the whirlwind is over water , animals near the surface , frequently fish and frogs , may suffer the same fate . essentially they are vacuumed up by the whirlwind , held aloft by updrafts , and finally dropped elsewhere . so while the rain is possible , some doubts do creep in . the rain of frogs depicted in this film may be of greater scale than i had pictured for a rain of frogs . it seems unlikely the frogs would still be alive when dropped . it is not clear that geographic conditions are right for los angeles to have this sort of phenomenon . ( frankly i have no idea on these points . ) otherwise the event was quite believable . what we see in this film is much more credible than the phenomena we saw in volcano . in the film it is left ambiguous if the rain is a sign from god since there are many references to exodus 8 : 2 . \" and the frogs shall come up both on thee and upon thy people , and upon all thy servants . \" however a rain of frogs , though it feels biblical , is most definitely not a biblical portent . note that the previous verse says \" and the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly which shall go up . . . , \" so the bible is referring not to a rain but to an infestation from the river . the only other reference to frogs in the bible is as a symbol for uncleanness in revelation 16 : 13 .',\n",

       " (\"seen april 16 , 1999 at 10 p . m . at crossgates cinema 18 ( guilderland , n . y . ) , theater # 15 , by myself for free using my hoyts ' critic ' s pass . [ theater rating : * * * 1 / 2 : very good seats , sound and picture ] do you realize that every time you encounter a new person you ' ve just become part of a story ? everyone has their own life story , both past and present , and every time two or more interact , they become part of each others ' story ( not necessarily an important or even significant part , but a part nevertheless ) . that seems to be the basic theory behind ` go , ' where several characters ' chance encounters all effect each other in extreme ways . in order to test this theory screenwriter john august and director doug liman assemble a cast of characters that wouldn ' t usually be the types to have an entire film revolve around them , such as a teenage supermarket cashier , a bottom - of - the - drug - food - chain dealer and two struggling soap opera actors . these types of characters might not sound all that original , but consider that they will all be somehow effected by a strip club bouncer and his psychotic father , a mid - level drug dealer , a narc obsessed with multi - level - marketing , horny wedding guests , a zen lovemaker , two shrimp - scarfers and a cute normal teenage girl to round things out . how they will all come together is the process the film deals with . i ' d imagine the concept to the film started out as the creators ' testing themselves to see if they could actually pull it off and the outcome is a terrific achievement in filmmaking and the craft of fiction in general . the film starts out as anything else , with little indication of what ' s to come . we meet ronna ( polley ) , a depressed los angeles checkout girl who doesn ' t seem to have much desire to do anything except work just to pay her rent . she ' s not very charming , especially to her customers , but this is played mostly for laughs rather than characterization and it works . maybe this is because she ' s not a very afeminite character , but she ' s far from masculine - a creative character indeed . things start to progress when ronna reluctantly agrees to take the hours of the goofy , hyperactive , yet likable simon ( askew ) , an english teen into vices for the sake of the experiences . this agreement starts a three - pronged storyline as it allows simon to go to las vegas for the weekend with his friends and in turn drags ronna and her friends into buying and selling an experimental drug . the process of which will not only bring ronna close to being arrested but also to death . nearly the same can be said for two other characters , zack ( mohr ) and adam ( wolf ) , who we don ' t think much of when they first appear as supporting characters , but later will become major players to the film ' s makeup - another process used by the filmmakers to elaborate on the theory of how significant insignificant interaction might be . once the pace is picked up the film really begins to show its mettle . when the title screen ` ronna ' is flashed shortly after the aforementioned turning point scene , it ' s clear this film isn ' t going to employ the standard linear method of storytelling . considering how good it is up until that point , it ' s a long overdue change of pace needed in movies today . and so the film begins to take shape , first by following ronna and her friends on a one - night adventure that begins with a drug deal instigated by zack and adam ( who were actually looking for simon ) , which doesn ' t exactly go as planned , but that ' s what keeps it all so interesting . the second storyline starts at the same moment as ronna ' s story , but this time the camera chooses to follow simon instead . simon and his three friends head to ? vegas for a night on the town and in the process experience things they never would have imagined . the third arc , about zack and adam , again overlaps with ronna ' s story telling much of the same story but from a completely different angle . we ' re shown things we never would have expected were going on while following ronna . and many of the events that do happen to ronna because of zack and adam aren ' t even their fault - they just happened to be where they were when they were . i ' d really like to dissect each of the three storylines and especially how the film wraps up in the end , but that would take up too much time and space and spoil everything for those who haven ' t seen the film . perhaps the greatest element to the film is its constant surprises and unpredictability , and not due to plot twists or a confusing screenplay , just through great filmmaking . still , i can list and analyze nearly everything the film does so well : ? direction : trying to piece together such a complex story is no easy task and for a rookie filmmaker such as liman , it ' s a great accomplishment . he doesn ' t just depict a story , he wraps us up in it all , pulling us into the fray so that we experience every high and low . ? screenplay : besides being chiseled with detail and creative in general , it ' s clear the script has been inspired by many sources , with both obvious and subtle references , yet it never screams ` rip - off . ' ? tone / mood : where other hollywood films have failed to bring the charm of the independents to the mainstream , this one is able to create its own sense of the macabre . it ' s not overly - dark or twisted and the comedy isn ' t so satirical for it to be considered a black comedy , more like ` macabre light . ' ? cinematography / art direction : able to photograph both the intense and the lighthearted in the same manner . ? characterization : for nearly every character introduced , no matter what role they play in the big picture , we ' re able to get a sense of who they are , what they ' re thinking and how they came to be in their situations . even when their actions are surprising , it never seems very out of synch . ? performances : every actor nails their role ( see above ) . ? theme / theory : the film doesn ' t seem to be concerned with conveying any kind of political or social messages , instead , it ' s more of a philosophical experiment . in fact , it might not have meant to do that intentionally , but there definitely is something existential to it all . . . . and to think that ` go ' is just a big comedy and adventure !

       " ('perhaps the most dramatic changes in the motion picture industry in this decade have to do with special effects . there is no question that action - adventure and science - fiction / action movies are now judged by the character of their light and noise . whereas classic adventure pics of the last twenty years , such as raiders of the lost ark , were made in grand traditional fashion ; contemporary films like jurassic park are multimillion - dollar creations of computer technology . the latest in this visually awesome series of movies , the wachowski brothers \\' the matrix , is a testament to the skilled use of special effects and its ability to enhance a movie \\' s story . unlike many sci - fi movies which promote themselves as effects - heavy blockbusters but fail to deliver on that promise , the matrix is a carefully constructed special effects event . it runs 135 minutes in length and employs a countless number of computerized tricks which range from gimmick to grandiose , and the quality of the effects remains constant throughout the film \\' s length . contrary to popular trend , the matrix commits itself to being a spectacle of light and sound . in this regard , the movie is something like a card sharp . with its flashy mass stripped away , the matrix would be quite shallow and untalented . the script is characteristically weak , and the dialogue suffers in lieu of a far more innovative visual approach . but , like the card sharp , the matrix wows its audience to such a high degree that actual content is irrelevent . the viewers don \\' t care about what the matrix has to say as long as the next special effects sequence is right around the corner . and right around the corner they usually are , for the script tells a fast - paced , albeit frequently revisited story . as the movie explains , the world as we know it is nothing but an elaborate computer program constructed by an artificial intelligence for the purpose of placating mankind . billions of human beings lie in this dormant state while the intelligence -- the matrix -- \" farms \" our life energy . only a select group of individuals knows of the \" real \" world , and a particularly ingenious squad of these rebels is led by ultra - cool morpheus ( laurence fishburne ) . morpheus and his crew recruit a computer expert named neo ( keanu reeves ) , believing he is a prophesied individual who will help them overthrow the matrix and return peace to earth . the cast plays out this story in stylish fashion . the set design is very dynamic , running the gambit between cramped and dreary to bright and airy . the costumes , as well as the actors who wear them , add to the roles . for instance , the manifested antagonists in the movie , a group of \" agents \" created by the matrix in its computer program , all dress in matching secret servicewear ; the rebel fighters , on the other hand , dress in rich hues of leather . the casting cannot be criticized , for the typically stoic reeves isn \\' t required to say much and laurence fishburne gets plenty of time to be so damn cool . supports in carrie - anne moss , joe pantoliano , and hugo weaving are all effectual . one of the best comparisons to thw matrix is last year \\' s science fiction masterpiece dark city , particularly if one ponders how this same premise would \\' ve worked from a different approach . the alex proyas film was far more dark and introspective , requiring a bit of thought before themes became clear ; here , the wachowski brothers have managed to construct a thrill - ride motion picture with little abandon and much noise . the better picture between the two depends on the viewer , but the key to the success of the matrix is that the noise did not get in the way of the fun .',\n",

( her character is also named ana ? s . ) sitting at the table morosely slurping down a banana split , her presence is grounded and heartbreaking . it \\' s a pity breillat never finds anything for her to do other than get defensive against her evil storybook sister , 15 - year old elena ( roxane mesquida ) , for bringing a transitory boyfriend home to their shared room . in this summer cottage , ana ? s has no escape from her position as stoic bedside observer to elena \\' s depressing confusion of cheap sex with romance . the boy in question , a smug italian college kid named fernando ( libero de rienzo ) is a real piece of work , claiming that the experience is a declaration of love while begging for a blowjob . ana ? s doesn \\' t receive any warmth from her largely absent parents , who join elena in making fun of her hefty girth . she finds pleasure in wandering the beach alone , singing songs to herself , and swimming in the pool kissing the metal railing and pretending that it \\' s her paramour . reboux commands the screen , but there \\' s only so much a child actress can do recounting pretentious monologues to herself . if one is inspired to rescue this young performer and place her in a better movie , at least she fares better than the other young talent asked to perform in intense love scenes that might feel justified if they weren \\' t so dramatically misguided . this 83 - minute vignette is something of a horror show , but breillat saves her nastiest poison for the very end . on the long ride home punctuated by an uncomfortable silence between family members , gigantic trucks swerve by as the hour grows late . will mommy fall asleep at the wheel ? perhaps . or maybe there \\' s something deadlier around the corner , lying in wait to pounce upon the unsuspecting fat girl . what \\' s more , she might even like it . with the intent of being unfair and unpredictable , placing her heroine in the most diabolical of corners in order to face up to impending adulthood , breillat \\' s extreme flourish of sadistic tawdriness reveals her as a master purveyor of contempt . fat girl is a bitter pill indeed . aka ? ma soeur ! screened at the 2001 new york film festival ( feature coming soon ) .',\n",

       " ('true faith and its expression through organized religion is a difficult subject for a motion picture to tackle head - on , which is probably why so few of them do it . even the most religious directors - like martin scorsese or ingmar bergman - usually address issues of faith in implicit rather than explicit religious terms . so it \\' s not hard to see why it took robert duvall fifteen years to get \" the apostle \" onto the big - screen . as a matter of fact , even after fifteen years he still never managed to get financial backing , and he ended up paying for it with $ 5 million of his own money . he also wrote the script , directed the film , and starred as the central character , a fiery texas preacher named euliss \" sonny \" dewey . few filmmakers have the courage and sheer audacity to take on that kind of financial , technical , and creative responsibility single - handedly , and it \\' s testament to what an intensely personal project this was for duvall . and , thankfully , every bit of that personal investment translates on - screen into power and honest emotion . sonny is an energetic , pentecostal preacher who has been speaking ( actually shouting ) from behind the pulpit since he was twelve . he spends much of his time traveling about the country , evangelizing with other preachers at tent revivals . unlike most hollywood characterizations of intense preachers , sonny is not a phony or a swindler , and the film \\' s purpose is not to unearth hypocrisy and sin in either sonny or the church . duvall makes it abundantly clear that sonny truly believes in what he says , although like all humans , he has weaknesses . one of his weaknesses become apparent when he finds out that , not only does his long - suffering wife , jessie ( farrah fawcett ) , want to leave him for another man in the congregation , but the two of them have secretly plotted to remove him as preacher . faced with the loss of two things he loves passionately - his church and his family - that same raw power that allows sonny to get entire congregations rocking and swaying transforms into a violent temper . at his son \\' s baseball game , sonny snaps and smashes his wife \\' s lover in the face with a baseball bat , inflicting a wound that may be fatal . not knowing what else to do , sonny disappears . he throws away his identification , drives his car into a lake , and takes a bus to louisiana , hoping to start over again . in the tiny , mostly poor coastal town of bayou boutte , sonny once again finds his calling . after befriending a simple auto mechanic ( walt goggins ) and tracking down the town \\' s ex - minister ( john beasley ) , sonny sets up his own church , the one way to heaven temple . re - christening himself as \" the apostle e . f . , \" he quickly draws together an eager congregation , and together they realize real change in each other \\' s lives . but , always , sonny \\' s past is lurking a step behind him , waiting to swallow his progress . duvall has made his intentions in making \" the apostle \" clear . in a recent article in \" newsweek , \" he wrote : \" filmmakers hardly ever depict spirituality with such a strong emphasis on the holy spirit , and when they do , it tends to be patronizing - full of charlatans and snake handlers . . . but what i really wanted to do was try to understand what these preachers go through and what they believe , and to portray it in an accurate way . \" the strength of duvall \\' s convictions turn out to be the strength of his film - \" the apostle \" always rings true , even in the most painful moments , because we know he \\' s being sincere with the subject matter . after fifteen years of traveling the country , listening to all shapes and sizes of ministers and taking studious notes on what they said , duvall has captured the energy and vitality of what it means to be truly spiritual . his sonny is a man who speaks directly to god and expects to be spoken right back to . \" i \\' ve always called you jesus and you \\' ve always called me sonny , \" he says . when neighbors call and complain that he is being too loud one night in one his rants with the man upstairs , sonny \\' s mother ( june carter cash ) just hangs up on them because she knows there \\' s no sense trying to interrupt him . the main theme to emerge from \" the apostle \" is the fact that good can come from any situation . sonny \\' s act of violence toward another human being is inarguably a horrific thing , and duvall never shrinks from that fact . however , that very same act of violence is what brings sonny to bayou boutte , where he finds people whom he desperately needs and who desperately need him . in his short time in louisiana , he does a world of good , and when the police finally show up to take him away , he goes quietly , knowing that he deserves the punishment that is awaiting him . and , as a scene during the final credits shows , he even turns his punishment into a positive opportunity for change and betterment . it is that strength in sonny \\' s character that makes him so appealing and magnetic to others - he is flawed , but he is powerful enough to overcome those flaws . weak men are the ones who simply accept their weaknesses and lack the desire to better themselves . watching duvall on - screen , it \\' s not hard to imagine that he would have been a magnificent preacher if he had chosen that vocation over acting . as sonny , he completely inhabits the character , and his performance is certainly the best of the year . because he spent so much time absorbing the traits , methods , quirks , and personalities of real preachers , duvall was able to create a complete character who always feels indelibly human . as a director , duvall feels that less is more . his camera simply takes in what goes on in front of it , with very little intrusion . there are no fancy crane shots or extended dollies or excessive close - ups . duvall knew that the power of the film \\' s characters ( enhanced by the fact that he cast mostly non - professional churchgoers and actual ministers ) didn \\' t need to be artificially enhanced . in this way , \" the apostle \" almost plays out like a documentary , not only in its technical simplicity , but more importantly , in its sense of reality .',\n",

because there is not one original idea in \" mission to mars . \" all of it is cribbed from other films ( and in most cases , better films ) . if this is the sort of thing you don \\' t mind , you might like the film . of course , there are other reasons not to like \" mission to mars , \" the main one being a script written by people who seem to assume their audience is filled with people who haven \\' t used their brains in some time , and who don \\' t intend to start during the film \\' s running time . \" mission to mars \" manages to be both stupid and boring at the same time . the plot , cribbed greatly from \" 2001 , \" concerns a team sent to mars , the first manned trip ever made to the red planet . luke graham ( don cheadle ) leads the team , jointly formed of americans and russians . the team encounters a mysterious monolith that emits a strange pulse ( this being nothing like the pulse - emitting monolith in \" 2001 \" -- that one was on the * moon * ) , but when they try to study it , a giant sand tornado comes out of the top and swallows them ( all except luke , who survives long enough to send a garbled message back to the rotating space station , which looks strangely like the rotating space station in \" 2001 \" ) . a rescue mission is planned with husband & wife team woody blake ( tim robbins ) and terri fisher ( connie nielsen ) , obligatory pilot with a troubled past jim mcconnell ( gary sinise ) , and extra crew member phil ohlmyer ( jerry o \\' connell ) along for the ride . after some zero - gravity dancing , they run into problems when one of their engines is blown , forcing them to attempt a desperate landing aboard a supply vessel . now stranded on mars with minimal supplies , the team must decide whether or not it can risk entering the monolith or if they should return home . after all , that monolith just might contain information about how life originated on earth . \" mission to mars \" is one of those films that makes a critic wonder where to start when talking about all the things that are wrong with it , so let \\' s start with one of the things that does work : director brian de palma manages to create some eerie tension in a few scenes during the middle of the film . that \\' s it . everything else fails . the failure isn \\' t de palma \\' s fault ; he \\' s working from an atrocious script . only during the sequence aboard the ship ( looking an awful lot like the jupiter vessel in \" 2001 \" ) where the rescue team \\' s air begins running out and they must frantically search for the hole and patch it up does \" mission to mars \" come to life . a scene where they attempt to save a comrade floating away into space also provides some tension , until you realize that the entire danger / more danger / attempted rescue sequence has absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the film ; it \\' s just a contrived way to generate thrilling scenes . take it out , and the plot isn \\' t affected in any way . the sequence also suffers from a few plot holes ( as does the rest of the film ) : why is the ship \\' s computer ( which sounds strangely like hal from , uh , \" 2001 \" ) able to detect a hole in the main chamber but not one in the engine ? why did tim robbins \\' character have to go outside the ship when the solution easily presented itself from inside ? shouldn \\' t the astronauts be better trained to deal with a hull breach ? why are the characters such idiots ? because the script makes little attempt to properly develop them . all the \" conflict \" is clumsily delivered in excruciatingly obvious exposition in the opening scene ( which rips off orson welles and robert altman by utilizing a long opening tracking shot ) during which the characters repeatedly tell each other about things all of them should already know : \" jim , it \\' s too bad you can \\' t go on this mission because you were determined \\' psychologically inadequate \\' because your wife died right before you were to go on the mission together \" -- does anyone really talk like this ? can \\' t we find out these things in a less grating matter , like maybe in a flashback ? the whole film is like that . the filmmakers are not content to merely show us something and assume we know what \\' s going on ; they must * tell * us exactly what we \\' re looking at * every * time . sample dialogue from the film : ( shot of mars ) astronaut a : \" look , there \\' s mars \" astronaut b : \" you sure that \\' s mars ? \" astronaut a : \" yeah , that \\' s mars all right . \" astronaut c : \" hey , are you guys looking at mars ? \" that exchange isn \\' t actually in \" mission to mars , \" but i wouldn \\' t be surprised if it were . for all their cribbing from kubrick , spielberg , james cameron , and even ron howard , the makers of this film haven \\' t learned to do something all those directors did very well : show and don \\' t tell . de palma used to know how , but seems to have forgotten . this is mentally - challenged filmmaking ; they assume the audience won \\' t get what \\' s going on , so they explain everything five times over . fourth - graders may appreciate this , but more learned viewers will have their intelligence insulted . the principal actors sleepwalk their way through \" mission to mars , \" never managing to do away with an apparent \" i \\' m just here to get a paycheck \" attitude . cheadle stumbles over his awkward lines . armin mueller - stahl manages to thoroughly embarrass himself in an unbilled cameo . robbins puts his game face on and phones in his standard \" decent guy \" performance . and sinise hams it up with \" wistful \" facial expressions while watching tapes of his dead wife ( played by kim delaney , who only has one scene during which she still manages to deliver some ridiculous dialogue in a heavy - handed monologue about the meaning of life ) , and especially during the stolen - from - no - less - than - three - movies ( a lollipop to whoever names them ) conclusion , which combines endless , obvious explanation and sub - par cgi effects with gagging sentimentality and is sure to alienate any viewers who had been enjoying the show up until then . and of course , these aliens from mars who facilitated the evolution of life on earth are entirely different from the aliens in \" 2001 \" who facilitated the evolution of life on earth ; those aliens were from an * unknown * world . it could be said that fans of brainless action films might enjoy \" mission to mars , \" but such a comment ignores the fact that the film is also incredibly slow - going . leisurely pacing might have helped a film with a little more substance to it , but all of the substance of \" mission to mars \" has been stolen from other films , and those other films dealt with their ideas in a much more thoughtful fashion and generally contained more engaging characters . supposedly we \\' re intended to choke up when one character decides not to return home at the end of this one ( totally different from the one - character - decides - not - to - return ending of \" armageddon \" ) , but i suspect most people will either be laughing or groaning . me , i alternated between the two . there is only one good thing about the way \" mission to mars \" finally ends : the fact that the movie is over .',\n",

       " ('wizards is an animated feature that begins with a narration of epic proportions . over black and white drawings , we are told that the earth is destroyed in an apocalyptic nuclear exchange , sending the remnants of humanity through generations of radiation - induced mutation . the \" original \" inhabitants of the earth , fairies and elves , return to populate the globe , along with their evil , mutant counterparts . one day ( and i say \" one day \" not to be trite , but because that \\' s exactly how it happened - no advance notice ) , a fairy queen gives birth to twins , one good and one evil . the twins grow up to be powerful wizards , the good one embracing magic , and the bad one utilizing technology to attempt to expand his evil empire . we are given the notion that an ultimate battle must occur between the forces of magic and those of technology . as unoriginal as the premise is , i was still somewhat interested in how this story would play itself out . there \\' s a lot you can do in an animated fantasy world , after all . i soon learned , however , that the fantasy was the expectation of a decent film . once the transition was made from still art to color animation , an entirely different feel takes precedence . rather than the epic saga promised by the narration , we get a goofy - looking world of a saturday morning cartoon . not just the look , mind you , but all the zany sounds like > honk boing for years , blackwolf has lost his battles against the magical forces of good , since his armies of ogres and other mutants would get dispirited or distracted soon after battle is joined . however , blackwolf now has a secret weapon : nazis . yup , adolf hitler , the luftwaffe and the wehrmacht . okay , not the real things , but an archival film his minions dug up . projected into the sky for all to see , it inspires his own army while shocking the enemy into submission long enough for the ogres to hack them up . before you know it , there are dead elves everywhere . this is just as well . the characters are so bad that the viewer doesn \\' t care about any of them . they \\' re either silly , sappy , or both . the dialog gets much of the credit for this . an example is when avatar nonchalantly says , \" well , looks like my brother and i begin our final battle . \" not very formidable when he \\' s also the guy who says , \" this is the biggest bummer of a trip i \\' ve ever been on . \" my favorite line was from a sideline fairy who is asked by her child why good can \\' t fight back against the nazi - charged evil . her response is , \" they have weapons and technology . we just have love . \" suffice to say , the characters are strictly two - dimensional , and we therefore don \\' t expect anything more than the obvious to happen . which it does . the only unexpected occurrence is the way the final battle between brothers is played out , which is anticlimactic and disappointing . please note that it is the action that is unexpected . that it is disappointing is not . the film couldn \\' t settle on a particular mood . it seems to move from dark to light with the cuts from scene to scene and even angle to angle . scenes which are seemingly meant to contain deep meaning are ruined by acts of levity . the dramatics , which seem to occur at random , are overly staged and overly acted , detracting from any kind of value or even enjoyment which could otherwise be gleaned . ralph bakshi , the director , makes an obvious attempt to get a message across in this film : hitler and the nazis were bad . so who doesn \\' t know this already ? well , maybe children . okay , so you might say that this is a movie for children . it \\' s not . in the scenes where good fights evil , there \\' s a lot of violence and gore that children should not be seeing if they \\' re watching a cartoon . so is the film for adults ? if so , we probably don \\' t need to be bashed over the head to get the point . why not have the bad guys be symbolic of the nazis instead of using old propaganda in a seriously disjointed attempt to show us something we already know ? wizards gives us a lot of footage of nazi tanks and airplanes , and hitler giving speeches . however , we don \\' t see any reason why they should be considered bad . we see no atrocities being committed , not even any real battle footage . there is absolutely no connection made between the armies of evil and the third reich , and we \\' re not even given a cursory explanation as to why this stuff is inspiring in the first place . this needed to be thought out much more thoroughly if a point were to be made , since subject matter such as this deserves better treatment . i \\' d like to assume that bakshi was trying to say that the same nationalist movement that drove the nazis could happen anywhere , at any time , and we must therefore be vigilant . however , i \\' m not sure if i want to give him that much credit .',\n",

       " ('sometimes you just have to tip your hat to a film . sometimes you just have to jump on the bandwagon and enjoy the ride . i saw the truman show with an audience full of teenagers , most of whom were no doubt drawn by ace ventura himself and hoping to see his latest take on fart jokes . surprised , they may have been , when they realized that this picture actually had something to say . but by the attentiveness of the crowd i \\' d say they were won over - as was i . i can \\' t tell yet if truman really is that good , or if it only seems that good in comparison to the awful mountain of crap spewed forth from the bowls of hollywood so far this year . time alone will make that call . but by the end of the film we were all on truman burbank \\' s side . we were concerned for his well - being , and wanted him to win . that we felt as we did is a tribute both to the film and to jim carrey , who has achieved legitimacy at last . the truman show is a film best viewed cold , with as little foreknowledge as possible about the plot . unless you \\' re under a media blackout , however , you probably know the basics . carrey stars as truman burbank , a capra - esque everyman insurance agent living with his beautiful wife meryl ( laura linney ) in the south florida island town of seahaven , which looks like michael eisner \\' s idea of the perfect american small town . truman would seem to live the perfect middle class lifestyle , complete with a working wife , a best bud , friendly neighbors and interesting co - workers . there is tragedy in his past - his father drowned in a horrible boating accident , leaving truman with a dreadful fear of water , and of travel in general - but overall , life is good . but then one day as truman leaves his house for work , a klieg light falls magically from the sky . this curious event may lead truman to discover what the rest of the world already knows : that he is a prisoner on the world \\' s biggest soundstage , that his wife , friends and relatives are all actors paid to interact with him , and that his life has , for over 10 , 000 days , been broadcast as the world \\' s most popular television program . what makes the first hour of truman so enjoyable to watch is the magical verisimilitude painstakingly constructed by niccol and weir . the soundstage , we \\' re told , is \" only the second man - made structure visible from space . \" truman \\' s movements are tracked ceaselessly by 5 , 000 cameras scattered throughout the town : button cams , dashboard cams , mirror cams , wife cams , big cams and small cams . weir cuts the film so we \\' re never quite sure if we \\' re watching truman through the camera of director weir or through the camera of the show \\' s omnipotent creator christof ( ed harris ) who oversees the show from a control room built into the man - made moon in seahaven \\' s sky . the second act offers a plethora of clues for truman as to the truth of his existence . his best friend marlon ( noah emmerich ) always has a six pack of beer with him . his wife seems to exist in an eternal commercial in which she is always endorsing the latest hot household product . he sees the same people walking in the same set patterns all over town . one wonders why he didn \\' t pick up on any of this earlier , but christof has an answer for this : \" people tend to accept the reality with which they \\' re presented . \" nevertheless , truman begins to grow restless , and dreams of escape to fiji , where an old college sweetheart ( natasha mcelhone ) supposedly lives . this convincing reality of television as progenitor of reality is a magical and provocative concept ; the best thing jim carrey does is stay out of its way . by underplaying truman , he allows the subtle manipulations of the film to take over . there is a particularly poignant scene in which truman confides his fears to marlon , and marlon answers with best - friend sincerity , \" i \\' d gladly step in front of a bus for you . \" but that line was fed to marlon through an earpiece by christof . the abject cruelty to which truman is subjected to hits home - and from that moment , we \\' re on his side . the truman show derives much of its success from playing to our own secret paranoid fantasies - haven \\' t we all , at least once , doubted our place in the world , doubted the sincerity of those closest to us ? ultimately , however , the picture rises above its own artifice to raise some real questions about the relationship of humankind and our creator . what does god really think of us ? does he resent our abandonment of paradise ? who exactly is watching us , up there in the sky ? if you enjoy the picture as much as i did , credit weir for allowing the magic of the screenplay to work . as for carrey - well , truman burbank is the kind of role that jimmy stewart was born to play . carrey is no jimmy stewart ; to his credit , he doesn \\' t try to be . he just tries to feel the way you or i would , if we suddenly found out that the whole world was watching us .',\n",

\" ohh ohh ee - tarzan - ee ee ohh ? \" well , regardless of my picky nature , the romance actually works as only disney romance can : purely contrived , but for some reason rather believable . but hey , tarzan \\' s a young adult . do you think he dated a few of the female apes before meeting jane ? isn \\' t that illegal in most countries ? oh , well . i don \\' t think disney will be using my quote anymore . tarzan departs from the usual disney feature in that this one is not a musical . there \\' s lots of music to be sure , but not a single character song in the whole hour and a half of running time . we instead get more of a phil collins concert , as no less than five of his original songs are used as interlude material . this isn \\' t really a bad thing , as the songs are very high - energy and catchy ( i found myself singing one to myself for most of the following day ) ; it \\' s just different . do yourself a favor and see this film in a theater with a good sound system , because the music will come through astonishingly well and really enhance the movie . with each new feature , disney animation gets even better . not necessarily by leaps and bounds , but since they put out a new film each year , a steady rate of improvement is apparent , and this definitely shows in tarzan . there are a couple of scenes where the animation achieves a near 3 - d effect , and a number of scenes which feature tarzan moving through the trees are absolutely dizzying . the way he slides down tree limbs and trunks is very reminiscent of skateboarding and rollerblading maneuvers , and had me thinking this isn \\' t just tarzan , it \\' s \" extreme tarzan . \" however , tarzan does not seem to have what i call its \" chandelier scene , \" which is the one scene to which the animators have chosen to devote an inordinate amount of effort , utilizing a computer - assisted process that makes the animation absolutely breathtaking . lasting but a few seconds at most , it \\' s been the signature of nearly every disney animated feature since beauty and the beast , in which the castle ballroom chandelier was rendered in stunning detail . as usual , the voice talent is up to snuff , convincingly make you believe in the convictions of animated characters . the one poor choice in casting , however , was rosie o \\' donnell . going into the film , i didn \\' t know she was even a part of it , but when terk started talking , i recognized her voice immediately . her performance was fine , but through the rest of the film i kept thinking , \" that \\' s no boy ape , that rosie o \\' donnell . \" distracting to say the least . i \\' ll admit i \\' ve never read the edgar rice burroughs story \" tarzan of the apes , \" so i couldn \\' t tell you how true this film stays to the book . but unless you \\' re a purist , you should have few objections to this film . with solid performances , action , adventure , a bit of romance , and great music and animation , tarzan should appeal to the kids and to the kid in all of us . note : when i wrote my review of mulan a year ago , i went off on the promotional and merchandising tie - ins prevalent with the release of a disney animated feature . this time , i \\' ll just say that i went to mcdonald \\' s yesterday to treat myself to a mcflurry , and tarzan was on the cup . \\' nuff said .',\n",

       " ('based on the relatively unknown ( in comparison to spider - man ) marvel comic book , blade tells the story of half - vampire half - human ( played by wesley snipes ) who was born of a vampire \\' s latest meal . now swearing vengeance against all vampires , blade hunts them all . his latest challenge is his biggest though . . . he must stop the vampire deacon frost ( played by stephen dorff ) from summoning the blood god and turning the rest of the world into vampires . admitedly , comic books are one of the least appreciated mediums , often viewed as juvenile by most standards , even seen as illiterate by some . judging by a series of poorly recieved ( financial and critical ) comic book based films ( such as batman and robin , steel , barb wire , the crow : city of angels , and the list goes on ) , one would come to the conclusion that comic books are the worst medium to translate into film . to some degree , i agree with this sentiment . having read comic books since the age of nine ( i \\' m 21 right now ) i can count the number of good comic book based movies ( not including japanese manga ) one hand : 1 : the crow ( 1994 ) , 2 : batman ( 1989 ) , 3 : superman , 4 : the mask , and now , # 5 , blade . ( \" men in black \" is not on this list because it is an extreme deviation from the original comic book ) why is this ? for the most part , it is because the filmmakers understand the comic book medium and come up with an appropriate atmosphere to match . the crow and batman comics call for a dark gothic atmosphere , which the director provided . the mask features a wacky superhero with off the wall antics , which the casting and cg effects reflect . superman is not over the top with colour and flash , and the film reflects this . blade uses common notions of vampires and incorporates them into the film , creating an appropriate atmosphere . this is in stark contrast to joel schumacher \\' s contrived vision in batman and robin , reflecting the dated atmosphere in the 1960 \\' s television show . batman and robin proved that the director failed to realize one fundamental fact : comics have grown up , and so has the audience ( i \\' m working on a scathing review of batman and robin and will post it up when i \\' m ready ) . which brings me back to blade . although he may be a familiar character to some , due to his appearances in the spider - man animated show on fox , one will find no single trace of the warm - and - fuzzy vampire hunter as depicted in the cartoon . the film depicts a vicious vampire killer that uses every single means at his disposal to reach his ends . the end results are not pretty by any means . the story elements work very well -- for a comic book story . screenwriter david goyer ( who also wrote the crow ) incorporates interesting elements of vampire lore , using science to explain many of the ideas often dismissed in vampire films . this is presented through karen , a hematologist portrayed by n \\' bushe wright . this leads to inventive use of standard medical treatments to kill vampires . add this to the neat little gadgets that blade uses ( including a titanium sword complete with an \" anti - theft device \" ) , and one has an interesting premise . however , the film works best as an action film . actor wesley snipes has an extensive background in martial arts ( most of which comes from capoeira , a brazillian form incorporating flashy kicks ) , choreographing every single move . proving that quick , flash cutting edits are no substitute for choreographed fight sequences ( see batman and robin for a good example of that ) , wesley snipes dazzles the audience with some incredible fight scenes . regardless , this film is far from perfect . the film suffers from at least one major plot hole , regarding the summoning of the blood god . the ritual requires that a number of pure blood vampires are standing on marked squares , yet one of them is viciously murdered , allowing the ritual to pass ( and the murdered vampire is later shown standing on the square ) . obvious continuity errors also surface , especially during a scene where deacon frost takes a drag on his cigarette and is not exhaling it in the next frame ( there is no trace of smoke either ) . much of the special effects are not that spectacular either . while vampire disintegration scenes are intriguing to watch , other cgi ( computer generated imagery ) effects are almost slapped together , which is surprising when given the amount of time the film was given to be released ( the film \\' s release date was pushed back multiple times ) . scenes with computer generated blood look extremely fake , knocking the believability factor down a few notches ( but then , i \\' m really hard to impress ) . the film \\' s r rating comes from gory violence , but the lack of realism made me wonder why it got such a rating ( for realistic violence , watch \" saving private ryan \" ) . the overuse of cgi in films has made me yearn for the days of director george romero and makeup wizard rob bottin , both pioneers in the art of gore without extensive use of cgi . still , scenes involving non - cgi special effects do surface ( and look much more impressive ) , such as one particularly gruesome scene where a vampire tries to use blade \\' s sword without deactivating the \" anti - theft device \" . wesley snipes is the saving grace behind what would have otherwise been a muddled mess . while not talking much , he is a grand physical presence , leaving other comic book superheroes in the dust . a decent ( by comic book film standards ) storyline also helps .',\n",

( giorgio cantarini ) are a happy family . guido has finally fulfilled his dream of opening a bookstore . but racial and anti - semitic tensions are on the rise in italy , and guido has determined to do his best to shield his son from these harsh realities . the task becomes even the more difficult when the family is deported to a concentration camp . here , guido must use all his skill and imagination not only to shield his son , but to keep him from being exterminated . it is at this juncture in life is beautiful may tend to offend those whom the holocaust has touched . for the scenes in the concentration camp lack the horror , the pain , the unimaginable suffering of a schindler ' s list . true , many italian jews were not deported until the war was nearly over , and most were not sent to the death camps , but to work camps where they were used as slave labor . unlike steven spielberg , benigni is not out to tell the story of the holocaust . his story is about family and the lengths a parent will go to protect a child . for guido , to save his son , transforms the entire experience into an elaborate game . giosue ? must follow the rules without question to amass 1 , 000 points . the winner takes home a tank . therefore , guido tells him , he must remain hidden in the barracks . he cannot make a sound nor allow the guards to see him . guido explains this during a hilarious sequence when a german guard barks the camp instructions to the newly arrived inmates . guido , lying that he understands german and can translate for his fellow prisoners , instead lays down the rules for his son to allow him a chance to survive . throughout their imprisonment , guido ' s quick thinking continually keeps his son from harm ' s way . ultimately , the allies rescue the camp . in a poignant scene , giosue ? comes out of hiding just as an american tank rolls into the compound . the boy goes wide - eyed with wonderment and delight , thinking he has won the game . the price for his victory is most high . benigni has succeeded in using the blackest moment in human history to prove that even in hell , a ray of hope and salvation can penetrate the darkness . life is beautiful is a fantasy , a fable . it is not to be taken as a record of the holocaust . those who object to it are missing its point . and that is simply where there is hope , where there is life and where there is love , the spark of humanity will never be extinguished . committed to lifelong learning through effective communication\",\n",

nazi skinhead , how he rose to power , how he was rehabilitated in prison after murdering two black men in a fit of rage that was less to do with the stealing of his car and more to do with proving himself , and how he tried to save others , namely his younger brother , from making the same mistake . we see him at all of these stages - as a smart teenager , a vicious hate monger , a man having an epiphany , and the man who tries to correct what he \\' s done before - and in all of these , we get a portrait of a man from all sides . or at least , that \\' s the intention . the film \\' s framing device is his brother , danny ( edward furlong , perpetually looking about 13 ) , also now a skinhead , and how his principal , bob sweeney ( avery brooks , who i just found out was or is the captain on star trek \\' s deep space 9 ) , is trying to \" correct \" him . when the film opens , danny has just written a book report on \" mein kampf , \" landing him in trouble with sweeney , which causes him to make him write a paper on derek \\' s life and how it has gotten him nowhere . coincidentally , this day is the day derek is released from prison , and when we see him , he \\' s cleaned - up , not as buff , and has a full head of hair . he \\' s just as intelligent , but still very rough along the edges , but he \\' s wisened up . he \\' s no longer controlled by his anger at blacks and jews , and tries to persuade danny , who \\' s becoming what derek was before , to give up his lifestyle . but danny won \\' t . he goes to a large skinhead beer bash , meets with the skinhead leader ( stacy keach ) , and then discovers that derek is as opposed to neo - nazi - dom as he was for it a couple of years ago . the film circles around this , then spins off into non - linear flashbacks , all done in black and white . we mostly see derek at his prime as a skinhead , living in venice beach , organizing vicious and quasi - sadistic raids on local stores that no longer hire the white , middle - class teenagers since they can easily get cheaper illegal immigrants to do the same work , and mouthing off his theories on affirmative action and how illegal immigrants and blacks have destroyed the fundamentals this country was built on . to them , the white man is the one who has gotten the fuzzy end of the lolipop , and he not only speaks elloquently , forcefully , and intelligently , but he backs everything up with political reasons , justifying their rage at least to them . and frighteningly enough , much of what he says sounds true . \" american history x \" is a collection of really great scenes and moments , rather than a cohesive , great film that flows effortlessly from one moment to the next . in it , there are some of the best scenes i \\' ve seen all year . one scene features a dinner between derek \\' s family , and his mother \\' s newest boyfriend ( played with reserve by eliott gould ) , a jewish liberal who quietly disagrees with derek \\' s rightist views , launching the scene into a fit of rage and anger that builds unparalled emotions in the audience ( gould \\' s reaction to derek \\' s final summation is unnerrving ) . another scene uses humor and traditional macho sex talk to build a friendship and a nice connection between derek and a black co - worker ( guy torry ) while folding laundry in prison . and another soon - to - be - classic is actually divided in two : the murder of the two black men that winds derek in jail , which contains a final murder so nasty that it may be the most revoltingly shocking all year . there \\' s much more to appreciate , like the acting , which is uniformly good , with stand - outs coming from avery brooks , beverly d \\' angelo ( as the long - suffering mother ) , and gould ( who has one horrible line , but other than that , comes off with the best performance he \\' s given in what seems like a really long time ) . norton walks off with the film , though , coming off with such intensity that he reduces anyone not doing an adequate job to rubble . in only the fifth movie of his career , norton has invented himself as one of the most reliable and intense actors of his generation , and maybe the best . there \\' s nothing like it when norton really gets rolling in this movie , spewing out lines with such authority that he commands all attention from the audience , coming off with power similar to that of a young maron brando . that he allows the little emotions to seep through is amazing . sadly enough , this isn \\' t going to be the great portrait of racism that it perhaps hopes to be . it \\' s too unambitious and even a little contrived to really take off as either a powerful statement or an emotional masterpiece . the ending , especially , is pencilled in from other movies , tossed in just so the emotional keyboard can be trounced upon . some of the skinheads are reduced to mere cliches ( kevin smith regular ethan suplee fairs rather annoyingly as the \" fat skinhead , \" whose lines consist without fail of expressing his desire to eat more ) , and even the dramatic arc isn \\' t as well travelled . furlong \\' s danny never seems to really be learning a lesson , since the flashbacks refuse to show his point of view , and when he decides to make a change by the end ( which was inevitable ) , it doesn \\' t seem like it has actually arrived there . even derek \\' s descent into skinhead - dom doesn \\' t seem justified . though his fireman father ( william russ , the dad from \" boy meets world , \" and don \\' t ask me how i know that ) is killed by a black junkie , and even before he spoke against affirmative action intelligently , there never seems to be any real back story why derek became so intense about his beliefs . as such , one can see why the director , tony kaye , wanted to have his name removed . sorta . \" american history x \" is a very good movie , and i was very moved by it , but it could be a lot better , and the problem seems to be that the cut as it is is not up to what he claims to be his potential . somewhere , he claims , there lies a tony kaye cut , and that was to be the true cut until it was viewed by norton , who then ordered another cut , and that is thus . although he aimed for the directing credit to go to \" alan smithee , \" the resident name for any film that is to be disowned by its director , it wasn \\' t allowed to him , under the grounds that once you disown a film , you can not badmouth it ( but really , that \\' s the macguffin - no one really wanted a film this good to be given the alan smithee sign of disapproval ) . kaye \\' s right in that it \\' s not up to par , even if he \\' s not referring to normal par but rather his own personal par . this will not be a \" do the right thing \" for the late 90s . yet it still gets its point across intelligently , and backs it up with its story ( its message , that one cannot be so enwrapped in one \\' s own beliefs or pain and suffering will occur , is literally said over the narration , unfortunately ) . and even if it isn \\' t perfect , at least when avery brooks turns to norton after he has been beaten and raped in prison , and asks him if anything he \\' s done has made his life any better , it realy hits a nerve , not only in derek , but also in the audience .',\n",

the movie finally dissolves into a really bad hallmark family special about realizing who you are and what you can be in this world -- with enough soft lighting and people on the verge of tears in every scene . pure and simple , the klumps is a failure . its script was handled by not one but five screenwriters , and it really shows during the awkward transitions between scenes . any sense of story and plot were lost in the rewrite process . it \\' s more discerning to learn that chris weitz and paul weitz , the team behind one of the funniest films of the last decade , american pie , have their names stamped to this trash . hey guys - quick note - keep this movie off of your resumes . the characterization of sherman \\' s family , the klumps , is one of the most ignorant stereotypes of a black family i have ever seen in cinema . everyone member of the family is a large person who wipes the bins clean at a local buffet restaurant like pigs at a trough . the grandma is an oversexed fiend who constantly talks of ways to pleasure her man and her sagging breasts . the father is gruff , is fired from a blue - collar job , is sexually inadequate , and cannot communicate with his family about his feelings . the mother is ignorant of all the negativity around her and seems to hold no opinion about anything or anyone . the brother is silent and brooding and resembles the ice cube gangster character from boyz in the hood . sherman himself is terribly insecure and never conveys anything for the audience to become attached to . but the main problem with the film is its inability to create any type of convincing conversational or situational comedy . the family scenes from the first nutty professor worked so well because their conversations were short and direct . and you got the feeling that these crass people couldn \\' t act like this all the time . the sequel does the reverse and drives the negatives of the klumps right in to the hilt , making the first five minutes of their interaction enjoyable and the last 55 or so unbearable and pathetic . after a while , their conversations just become a barrage of frustrated anger tinged with indecency and overworked premises that end up drawing energy away from any type of empathy one might feel for the central themes of the story . its also a damn shame that the makeup magic of rick baker -- who worked on the original nutty professor and won an academy award for his work on an american werewolf in london -- and amazing digital special effects that enabled murphy to interact with himself in such beautiful motions are built around such a lame story line . even the best effects can \\' t seem to save the most pathetic of movies these days . now that i think about it , the worst thing about this film has to be all the money that it will make . people will be lined up around the block for it . the studios will concoct the a sequel for release in the summer of 2002 . eddie murphy will be signed up to take not just one role or five roles , but he \\' ll play every character in the movie . i just can \\' t wait to see eddie murphy in a love scene with himself .',\n",

       " ('kids today , they don \\' t just want to see heartthrob and master thespian freddie prinze jr . loving on the ladies . no , they want to see him doing something that takes a little more in the acting department : namely , playing baseball . through a series of drippy voiceovers , we are informed that there \\' s no better proving ground for major league baseball than the cape cod summer baseball leagues , where college also - rans and hopeful dropouts go to play in the hopes of attracting big league attention . our man freddie has landed a spot as a pitcher on the prestigious chatham a \\' s , where he is hoping for his big break . it \\' s only after he is given ample time to show off his abs and scamper about in a woman \\' s thong ( don \\' t ask ) that we learn what the real story of summer catch will be : that prinze is a poor townie named ryan dunne , struggling to make a name for himself ; that neither his father ( fred ward ) nor brother ( jason gedrick ) pulled themselves out of their blue collar jobs and resent anyone who tries ; and that the local beauty tenley -- tenley ! ( jessica biel ) -- is so far out of his league that he probably shouldn \\' t even bother . . . but of course he makes a play for her . summer catch also makes an abortive stab at another half a dozen subplots -- the jealousy of fellow townie and brazen slut dee dee ( brittany murphy ) , the alienation felt by ryan \\' s non - baseball playing best friend ( gabriel mann ) , or the fat chick fetish of fellow player miles ( marc blucas ) . worst of these is a ludicrous bit involving that \\' 70s show \\' s wilmer valderrama and beverly d \\' angelo , both of whom appear in the film simply to provide a nutty mrs . robinson - like substory and to remind you of how much better done that was in bull durham . in fact , virtually all of summer catch feels like it \\' s been done better somewhere else . for starters , the film has a major question of identity . it \\' s definitely not a sports movie , and it fails pretty miserably at being a romance . the worst part is the amateurish script ( co - written by an arli $$ writing alumnus and a guy that starred in leprechaun 3 ) , chock - full of phony emotion . by the end , it all becomes a platform for each character to deliver a soliloquy to ryan that he must take to heart . dad is on hand to give fatherly yet drunken advice . coach ( brian dennehy , just loving the fact that he \\' s got some work on the big screen ) is on hand to give the curmudgeonly counterpoint . ryan \\' s catcher ( matthew lillard , playing himself again ) is on hand to tell ryan to \" play catch \" with him and make fun of the fat fetish guy . ryan \\' s stoner best friend is on hand to give the go - get -\\' em - tiger - we \\' re - behind - you talk . and the girlfriend is on hand to give heartwarming - nuzzly - follow - your - dreams counsel . before long , you start to wonder : is freddy prinze jr . is capable of having a thought of his own ? don \\' t answer that . the only real joy in the film is found in biel \\' s character , and not just because of the skimpy outfits , which are also usually wet . she \\' s the only one in the movie that is able to do much with her role , taking the rebelling - against - daddy character to at least a passing grade . when she \\' s on screen , the time flies by . when she \\' s not , you realize that for some ungodly reason this movie is almost two hours long . for a pg - 13 teen romance ( despite near - constant sexual innuendo ) , one has to ask warner brothers : what were you thinking ? ? ? for her part , biel has fallen so far from her 7th heaven roots that she has almost become denise richards . hollywood is either about to eat her alive . . . or vice versa . either way , good luck , jessica . as for freddie , if he keeps pumping teen romances out at the rate of two a year , prinze \\' s next \" summer catch \" is liable to be a venereal disease .',\n",

       " (\"disillusioned and trying to find the spice of life , richard ( leonardo dicaprio ) sets off for thailand . there he a meets crazed man by the name of daffy ( robert carlyle ) who gives him a map to a beach , a secret utopia , then commits suicide . richard sets off for this beach with his neighbors from this hotel , ? tienne ( guillaume canet ) and fran ? oise ( virginie ledoyen ) . once they get there the three discover a secret society existing on this beach , there richard falls for fran ? oise . this covers about half to two thirds of the movie and aside from the romantic element , which is solely a creation of hollywood , seems to hold to the original novel . the cinematography and general beauty of this part of the movie is breathtaking . i don ' t think anyone can argue that this movie is visually stunning . but that is were many things go wrong , darius khondji has totally outdone himself in doing the cinematography . though the script and the interpretation of the novel are quite lacking . the plot of the movie moves along at a decent pace for about half of the movie or there abouts . this is where the movie has some great potential , then the three travelers get the island and there is a turn for the better , yes folks i said better . now up to about two thirds of this movie its actually pretty good , nothing spectacular aside from the cinematography but it still has promise . this is where things start to degenerate to something that becomes almost un - watchable . there is even a ' video game ' style sequence that borders on the disgusting , it doesn ' t make sense for the movie and just looks dumb in my opinion ( and i am hoping many other peoples ) . i am hoping that in my little rant i ' ve made it abundantly clear that the movie is lacking quite seriously in plot and uneven pacing , so if you go see it and you don ' t like it because of this don ' t blame me . the character development was not up to par either ; i found the character of richard to be nothing more than a spoiled child . although there is a feeble attempt to make this whole story profound it fails and richard ( leo ' s character ) comes off as a wannabe philosopher . the character seems to be underdeveloped from the get go and seems to just do things for no apparent reason , granted some people are like this ( myself included ) but i nor anyone i know that is fairly random would ever do things of the sort this character does . the next point is that some of the really interesting characters are simply not developed enough . richard is obviously obsessed by fran ? oise at the early stages of the story , yet there is actually very little development along this story line . this i am sure contributes to the movie ' s lack of core plot and being unfocused . now , i shall move onto something a little better about the movie ( for all you cynics out there the movie did have a few good things about it ) . the cast and acting was passable at the very least , and i think that leonardo dicaprio actually did pretty well in the role of richard . mind you i think the rest of the cast that had some which had reasonably sized roles did equally well if not better . which begs the question why is leonardo paid so much ? ( i think this is a topic all on its own so i won ' t get into it ) . but i like the fact that there was an international cast used , had only and american cast been used i can see this movie being horrible . the international flavor added a more global feel to the movie that made it that much more bearable . not to mention the movie is set in thailand and a global cast makes more sense . when all is said and done i liked the movie for the most part but the gaping inadequacies of the plot are unforgivable . i would not recommend this movie to anyone , the fact that i liked it has a lot to do with the cinematography and the sheer beauty of the movie not its plot or story . as it is the story tries to be much too philosophical and fails at its attempt . if you do end up going to see this movie be forewarned about its shortcomings .\",\n",

       " ('the marvelous british actor derek jacobi stars in writer and director john maybury \\' s love is the devil about the popular modern artist francis bacon . as always , jacobi \\' s acting is impeccable , but the movie tries hard and succeeds at being unentertaining and opaque . the movie convincingly argues that francis , played by jacobi , was a completely despicable and vain individual , but it never provides any insight into his work or any motivation for his attitude . when interviewed by a fawning talk show host , francis calls his style \" chance brushstrokes . \" starting with a burglary of francis \\' s flat , the film uses loud sound effects that sound like they were lifted from a cheap horror movie . the camera shots are heavy on the avant - garde angles -- lots of wide - angle close - ups and distorted shots filmed through colored - glass reflections . the director is much more interested in filmmaking style than in the substance of the story with the result being a sterile examination of a lonely and vain man . daniel craig , in a lifeless performance , plays the burglar and boxer , george dyer . when francis lays eyes on him after the break - in , francis promises not to call the police if he \\' ll stay for sex . he stays for the entire movie but never respects the man with whom he shares a bed . he thinks that francis \\' s paintings have \" no bloody use , \" and the movie presents no counterargument . writer maybury barely outlines francis \\' s character , and george and the rest of the supporting cast remain a complete enigma . we learn little of george other than francis \\' s reason for liking him -- george \\' s \" amorality and innocence . \" francis \\' s love of sadomasochism is shown early and often . \" boxing is such a marvelous aperitif for sex , \" he reflects to george on the way to watch a boxing match . as the fighter \\' s head is sliced open with a heavy blow , the camera cuts to a gleeful francis whose own head is soaked by the flying blood . francis appears to be in complete ecstasy . another of francis \\' s favorite activities is viewing old movies of atrocities . as the carnage mounts , we witness an orgasmically happy francis in the audience . in a film that tries obsessively to shock , one dream sequence portrays a family in a car accident . francis \\' s mind slowly examines every bloody limb of the mother , the father , and the boy . sometimes the script throws us tidbits of francis \\' s wisdom which illuminate little while merely sounding insightful . ( \" i \\' m optimistic by nature . i \\' m optimistic about nothing . \" \" loneliness is my only true companion . \" ) we learn more details about francis \\' s makeup techniques than about the man himself . he prefers shoe polish for his hair and sink cleaning powder for his teeth . full of metaphorical interpretations , the film \\' s best scene occurs late one night when george has to get up to go to the bathroom . mistaking francis \\' s picture of a toilet for the genuine article , he urinates on it and then crawls back into bed contentedly . like a parody of a bad art house movie , love is the devil has horrid characters filmed bizarrely and confusingly by a director who is much more interested in technique than storytelling . by the end , the audience hasn \\' t learned any more than it could have in a three - minute sketch . love is the devil runs 1 : 30 . the film is not rated but should be considered nc - 17 for violence , profanity , graphic sex , nudity and sadomasochism and is unacceptable for most teenagers .',\n",
